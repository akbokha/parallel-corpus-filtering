Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is cri@@ tici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversi@@ al speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was partly counted as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election that was forth@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call professor , his friend shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was p@@ inion on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was trained in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already shot 300 miles on the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that universities employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal disaster some@@ time later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and instruc@@ tors forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what was motivated by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students told that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty comprised 17 members and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which the Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee for him an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that the Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University that has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , teaching ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long@@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool senior guy , who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the woman &apos;s s@@ warm at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings his own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica at night before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on the ti@@ dying and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb made an emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb drew Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there was no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us intends to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that there is not so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that there are 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said that this month , it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business draws closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to furn@@ ish shops with employees that sell , send and distribute products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated lim@@ b and a arm length of it , with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the greatest journey of time , ever fil@@ med . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says , his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ solu@@ ble .
&quot; B@@ an called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in order to deal with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving nuclear dis@@ agreement with Iran . &quot;
8 Data Query Results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys down , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys , Donald Tr@@ ump showed in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts empha@@ size that at this time Rick per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic gruppe Club for Growth now detect g@@ umps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
umps Any@@ where have been rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans found the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
&quot; by mid July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with dump as candidates .
&quot; in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; if tr@@ ump would be short@@ listed . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say they would &quot; &quot; anno@@ y &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusi@@ as@@ tically &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in matter of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans does not see the m@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of ten indepen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament does not pass into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their hon@@ esty , republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since then , when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P elect@@ ors Tr@@ umps campaign might be plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump attacks almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the frag@@ rant box probably contributes to the m@@ umps leading while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ ap the majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump , say they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , two months ago named immigrants from Mexico , called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic balance of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently also will do . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s up to new levels .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent dis@@ satisfied and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the &quot; &quot; Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg &quot; , &quot; the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a rented roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; the study is therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter will cost most .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top right here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper in Pir@@ aeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit from Thomas Müller paved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sou@@ venir of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the witch &apos;s c@@ aul@@ dron of Pir@@ aeus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Miller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es Treffer ( 89 . ) deser@@ ves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth victory in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller was awarded with his 28 results in the Champions League to the Bayern @-@ guided co @-@ operation of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass a ste@@ ak of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept talking . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ iny .
&quot; Pir@@ aeus won his last six home games in the top class , including against famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their offensive efforts , however , often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by shi@@ fted to the left outside Douglas Costa which sel@@ dom passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller , from the right hand , had more luck than his flan@@ k beat out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper pe@@ at . &quot;
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion issued the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct pick , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee par@@ ched ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria re@@ acted her usual game , Pir@@ äus was able to set needle @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
so about when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56 . ) .
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ leg@@ ged ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , back to mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Held has only given green light after finishing the final training , said Matthias Sam@@ mer for &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants something else from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ . ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller was sitting there . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was in the stadium to cr@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavarian fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ block manifest@@ ed the followers of host Pir@@ aeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich tr@@ ailers . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was in@@ jured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : with wai@@ ver the risk decre@@ ases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fast . &quot;
the scientists had watched over 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stres@@ ses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; smoking is a risk factor for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , however , smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment fall back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ ker , declared head of study at H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health until old age after our findings .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of imp@@ unity affected , the DI@@ f@@ E condemned . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remn@@ ants from the late Anti@@ ke
&quot; for repeated time , on the right bank of the Rhine , Cologne arch@@ e@@ ological finds have been made . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ eton and remains excav@@ ated , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn as a department of archaeological ground care . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , the archae@@ ologists were now five . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress , and in the 8th century , a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
beside remains of the fortress and the church of Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of goods cap@@ tures
&quot; after a young woman died at the railway station in Medjugorje , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;

EU Commission pro@@ poses new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement ( T@@ TIP ) .
&quot; the controversi@@ al private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functionality comp@@ lies with significantly more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens dare , &quot; &quot; explained the responsible Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the show . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the US free trade talks .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; in concrete terms , the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings demonstrate that the EU and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
a second instance is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gments .
&quot; until now , the proceedings were agreed with one another to arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a claim against their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , dispute between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the large opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; traditional tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , on which companies disp@@ ose of damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , form@@ ulate national laws or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals from the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot;
it was specially critic@@ ised that they should not be considered for the free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ ETA ) .
&quot; the German economic state secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ern ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as big progress . &quot;
&quot; at the reform , the Commission considered important points for the reform of the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EUROP@@ E warned against limiting the cost of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , on Wednesday un@@ clear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered no longer durable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of various places he repeatedly records on the map , he tells about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they were born and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative mad@@ ness .
&quot; the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear wis@@ ely composed songs , which are harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late 1960s , but could drift into great op@@ ul@@ ente at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a lost series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already 2004 and in the near of the Rhine is already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and has a positive , certain expectations . &quot;
stop St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician lives back to the series in New York .
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The R@@ oise &quot; ) , a nation@@ ally celebrated master@@ piece appears in 2005 . &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album climb@@ s into the US b@@ ill@@ board and is missing in no annual list of the influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colorful spect@@ acle of ne@@ on end bands and great fluor@@ escent stage design . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
&quot; although here almost 2000 guests can sit in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience , one can hear : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens seems modest , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally tends to be under ro@@ aring appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ unde in prime minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected by the Prime Minister Fra@@ gest@@ unde &quot;
&quot; the New Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s ques@@ tionn@@ aire and , for the first time , set up with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ defined questions just after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be controlled by the media and the Labour MPs from the proximity . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ des , has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood resp@@ ect@@ fully &quot; &quot; and he had recognised the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , spoke at the BBC Two News night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve as leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they were called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; st@@ acks &quot; and indeed , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes were set in order to remove the whole idea of constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory boss since he has been over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament over the past decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s ques@@ tionn@@ aire is too con@@ front@@ ative , and that he has both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the road@@ side with counter @-@ hooks and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Sh@@ adows Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; which is often associated with the British Prime Minister &apos;s ques@@ tionn@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; since they were first sent to television in 1990 , the ques@@ tionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , even though critics have argu@@ ed that she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds climb@@ s through acceler@@ ated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the pound jump@@ ed like data , which show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the tow@@ ing target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom rose by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the quick@@ est and brought up ass@@ ess@@ ments over the time of an interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after tak@@ eover of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - returns growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 b@@ n $ through a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment for the company rating &quot; &quot; selling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport@@ s@@ wear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor cost of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; it goes both - and in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida rally with the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile sent the Leban@@ ese to the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the Authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
that is why Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary understanding of international understanding is good . &quot;
met@@ cash launches ground@@ breaking campaign for the fight against algae collapse
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash launched a floor stand campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the ap@@ ron of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A tra@@ ders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop owners who sell the cheapest tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ous provin@@ cial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di is cut away twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A ret@@ ailer could lose $ 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash about $ 13 million in pre @-@ interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ abol@@ ism loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , stated that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS market share has been dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which accounts for about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects its operative debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , hon@@ ors and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label products . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , hopes that the merchant in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ves praise for his own behaviour after the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; special Ks , &quot; came into the spot@@ light by the not@@ ori@@ ous argument of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison excl@@ aimed : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka had to beat C@@ yrene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp s@@ acked a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am fairly her@@ al@@ ous is the fact that according to my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost in the US Open because of a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature , 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly did not support C@@ yr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deser@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand@@ able . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were gathering in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations asc@@ ended .
&quot; as a helic@@ opter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot;
some reported food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries will take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c in a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were looking for asylum in the rus@@ hing Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was made that the EU states would record more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not set his hopes for a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or his neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were used in the race , the Stach@@ el@@ dra@@ ht fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sent@@ ences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency state , &quot; said Mr Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs in days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ or for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come about by damage the fence , they are now in police cu@@ sto@@ dy , and are accused of committ@@ ing crimes to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the limits . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and squ@@ ee@@ zed a crowd to impose themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in getting there , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he candidates for the presidential office , receive support of 15 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the preliminary elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these j@@ umps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support among the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elect@@ ors of the pres@@ election nation@@ wide say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the Party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some privileges , and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elect@@ ors of the pres@@ election states that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their peak andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman president becomes President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ers are also c@@ ited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the pres@@ idency of the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers will see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elect@@ ors of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ ds were their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bending is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elect@@ or@@ ate of the pres@@ election results as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results with some important features for vot@@ ers of their party pres@@ election .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
Bi@@ den is best among the three candidates for hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is leadership .
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , about a quarter of democratic elect@@ ors have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most democratic elect@@ ors of the pres@@ election are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions in all . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; now , half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the elect@@ ors of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the vot@@ ers have seen Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks for guidance . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards differently rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no idea of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to Donald Tr@@ ump in nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the vot@@ ers support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue supporting country wide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son reaches well with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Scott Walker , who fell the deep@@ est , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the fault mar@@ gins in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - he lands with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found a few si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holiday@@ makers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; swimming temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood put bur@@ dened by the death of Bar@@ uch college ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder complaints are lod@@ ged against five people . &quot;
members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Fr@@ at@@ ernity attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brutal during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital leading to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to reach a target over a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; members of the P@@ i @-@ del@@ ta P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood call not the number 911 , after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and osten@@ si@@ bly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the chic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an acc@@ us@@ ation due to Mor@@ des &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ en@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned it , then we will also be ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rate
&quot; interest income is coming , and the house @-@ se gets into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US central bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a view of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest can make things vol@@ ati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be weigh@@ ed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ sts in a recent study on what has happened after interest in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been relatively flat over the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat over the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob Doll , Head of Anne@@ x Strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but they often promote interest .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a rec@@ ession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest units since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest in a so frag@@ ile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have agreed on a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade shows only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increase cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the BI@@ P and before rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was vol@@ ati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a interest rate and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic direction .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer link between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still war@@ y to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , len@@ ders have expanded and vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that will take advantage of the greater part of their operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are increasing and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multin@@ ational corporations with high deb@@ ts become worse because an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their deb@@ ts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the increasing amount of dollars . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM . member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
the conservative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; de@@ duction &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly in@@ distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does not do anything what the private sender does . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot;
BBC Director General dismis@@ sed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tou@@ g@@ her needed to be involved to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports , to put the commercial ri@@ val on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; on a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales climb@@ ed in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed down the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping had fired , and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales company the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyer started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the rel@@ inqu@@ ishing sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
last year five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some res@@ eller sites crashed .
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 £ expenditure was issued more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried those killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first bur@@ ial sites in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia evi@@ den@@ ces the collapse in part of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were in@@ jured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; gri@@ eving filled , largely dressed in white , the track to cle@@ ave their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em C@@ emetery . &quot;
&quot; the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession moved to the holy place , where only days before a construction crane was over@@ thrown by the mos@@ que ceiling and then upon the praying . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King talked about the construction company of the B@@ in Laden for the disaster which also left 394 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the bodies of 29 who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ atz in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to go to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the B@@ in Laden group did not have to leave the arm of the sick , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the B@@ in Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the B@@ in Laden group has not made any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the royal decree also ad@@ ored the group due to non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
do@@ zens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project managed by the B@@ in Laden group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been connected with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a tr@@ un@@ born son who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; officials said that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent in@@ jured . &quot;
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets close nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer and City Boss Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that British are laying down their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; for British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , such as the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director from King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the nur@@ sery chain , said that a large increase in number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are gear@@ ed to professional tr@@ ades@@ men and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .
&quot; at the moment , men prevail among the employees . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , making more refurb@@ ishment than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this more strongly to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CF@@ O . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ y@@ sters A@@ ich / D@@ ob must answer due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and withdrawal .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of ministers .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this repro@@ ach in May .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigations , that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , to whom they were allowed to disper@@ se in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with some 400@@ ,000 euros , the damage is reported . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact f@@ are@@ well to the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the acc@@ us@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was no longer a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only compens@@ ated for rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement and the sports club , for which they had spent much time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the passi@@ v@@ ations amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 b@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in bread@@ making large @-@ scale conf@@ lic@@ ting of the financial department . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the capture . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there must be no deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success , the withdraw@@ als of the expenses were decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the expenses was only paid years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; so also l@@ ump and non @-@ detail reservations , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us shared the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for financial support , it was important for the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one official investigation on account of am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; that had been revers@@ als , the accused declared . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know any answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , finally , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ endant had been informed , justified the official . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With him ye are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the official said , he never referred to a c@@ ents , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ eting , he charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual cost was much higher , he added . &quot;
detailed documents for the early years could not demonstrate the def@@ endants .
&quot; they were not kept in store after an audit in which everything had been properly evaluated , they explained . &quot;
the second def@@ endant had also covered the kilomet@@ re .
&quot; all Beh@@ eb@@ ut@@ ations were made in cash , for that , from his place of residence , he had to go to the bank to lead to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition , for three years running personnel reduction , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company . &quot;
&quot; this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing reduction of 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year . &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares issued 2.3 percent .
&quot; the group , grown with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently expanding : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business shares should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ appoint@@ ing PC sales , as well as a we@@ aker demand for corporate customers after its services , continued to use the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded late to that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets taking place instead of conventional computers , and always do more business online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans will see overall the disman@@ tling of some 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were refl@@ ecting . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , find 61 percent positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents reb@@ elled , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 66@@ th I@@ AA
&quot; at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September , self @-@ driving cars as well as e @-@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66@@ th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
&quot; the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA car association count as two years ago , with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence break on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , the Hungarian police have used several hundred refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence break at the point of border control .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees passed through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a water@@ maker was ready behind the police officers .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , poles and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
&quot; at first , the officials replaced un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly pep@@ per@@ mint spray . &quot;
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now waited for something .
a pregnant and apparently in@@ jured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , scre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; other refugees s@@ acks in themselves , and suffered from respiratory problems . &quot;
also the Prussi@@ ans of the Ser@@ b police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ mint spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. emergency bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of opinion was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25 % will be kept . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , since it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less favourable outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University leaving certificate of debt
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; gave authorities known on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , having shot on a man , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will be up@@ set . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb Lamb had 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he ignor@@ es nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , I inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doctor@@ ate from the Delta State University , such as his li@@ fel@@ ess on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stres@@ s@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also suppos@@ edly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 executives , the Group structure will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , there is no new negoti@@ ation . &quot;
the Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the German equity holder Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is an annual contribution of approximately 500 million euros per year from cost and redemption sy@@ ner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the Executive Board to head Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt .
&quot; with the new production , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines were under the umbrella of the Passage airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pil@@ ots
&quot; in tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot organization Cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stopped this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provisions for pil@@ ots .
&quot; in one year &apos;s cock@@ pit , &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; as quickly as possible for sustainable results . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pil@@ ots , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa has out@@ sour@@ ced routes to the Group &apos;s own image line Euro@@ wings . &quot;
under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; paintings of Le@@ ena Kr@@ ü@@ ger can be seen in the Künstler@@ haus .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play Mon@@ day@@ ang because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign distributor to cr@@ ying and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
it was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double bone structure and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the displac@@ ement of an el@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian arbit@@ r@@ ator had gone wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;
Manchester United covered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break@@ through when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ eno said in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ aller .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost entirely . &quot;
&quot; unless you are , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 , chose Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead added a content of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hoping to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , reads . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly as a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is as@@ cri@@ bed to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the story of the book . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , due to the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a hock@@ ey , sn@@ ared way , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twice in a row in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a y@@ outh@@ ful attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; leaving Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , as - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out more races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not give such good performances , and that surprises me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time a test dr@@ ummer gets to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and game .
&quot; the only repro@@ ach you can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a dr@@ ummer I guess . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the crew composition in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , what would get an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four ticks , di@@ pped up and I don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ ummer can &apos;t hit there , and this lef@@ th@@ and has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has done three hundred things right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the cad@@ res , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .

&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy enters into a fl@@ au@@ te by 2017 .
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished innovation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will fall into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C which was sever@@ ely broken for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend states that some member states , too deeply entr@@ en@@ ched into various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturb@@ ing treaty changes , which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it may not , if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges sel@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking forward to the UK outside of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s war@@ y ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as it is in the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation long out@@ ings such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande faces his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Self@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may deliberately not inten@@ tionally resolve any helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a loan &quot; and &quot; Great Britain won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics did not have the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone in 1975 they did not support our entry 1973 with a 2 : 1 ratio .
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; in all his cra@@ zin@@ ess , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing chic@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do @-@ In@@ lands , which have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Bl@@ air was thinking about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better ban@@ anas distributed to di@@ stract him instead of having dinner and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened its doors to him . &quot;
the press has never happened to him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time to waste for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa it left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it very friendly - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blo@@ om tendency and the wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television said this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it rem@@ inded me of the 70 @-@ s years , when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour &apos;s Cab@@ inet of Labour , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the vort@@ ex of social media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of the petty difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for resign@@ ation - will be committed to foreign diplom@@ ats , trying to find in all a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was rem@@ inded at the start on Monday of what was called British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Grund@@ Markets Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y base &quot; on the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained means to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; is syn@@ onymous &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products by most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the asser@@ tions of P@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were premature .
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to it are small , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers than tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System of two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders says former head of Channel 4
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to do the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversi@@ al time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least expect its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for that . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would dimin@@ ish the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC training on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will show what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are fulfilling their duties and they can argue when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who vote for $ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that is correct , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the publicly @-@ legal tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ions in Australia and Canada , for example to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television will be shown , and enter alli@@ ances with commercial sen@@ ders to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred lit@@ ters with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have sound impulses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impulses work by turning mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ ound waves .
more on this topic : read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bu@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bu@@ b@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ nit@@ aries .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when it applies ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmit into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be revealed to a optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves tissues can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the picture of a tank . &quot;

the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work at the Museum für Bug@@ yi Designs in Bank@@ sy Dis@@ painted .
&quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; , &quot; a 6 £ &quot; pack of Allen key keys , which is claimed that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

&quot; according to G@@ avin Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries . &quot;
&quot; many artists participate in protest movements within protest movements and realize that they must move out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the arms trade - through a le@@ asing of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic commercial advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;
what we need now is a breach of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tr@@ aded illeg@@ ally before our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ er 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have up@@ set - and to the numerous , long @-@ armed complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residen@@ ces extends from slightly nerve @-@ trac@@ ing to absolutely fright@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to w@@ ading : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ara where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in earn@@ est , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it dire@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes came into fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and put their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow @-@ fellow is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it a message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos drop : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclu@@ des through baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the high point of back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have put you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mix@@ tures of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop . &quot;
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chick@@ ens are a th@@ ief , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it balanced as my ro@@ ommate , who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of what you are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it with even more loud music .
&quot; when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to enter the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed when you stop a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner , to get rid of them , and you might have to see them every day and perhaps experience how to move all common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , but never cut someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their poss@@ essions at the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , Solo@@ ists , Ger@@ ing@@ deserve &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Central Franconia Eck@@ ental terrac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need homes , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the well @-@ deser@@ ved . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how to build good and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ der , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dan : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; deb@@ tors : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is about 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Sett@@ ing App , &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you are ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message telling the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is returning or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has been more likely to do this by adding the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you insert a special tool , delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth it to make sure your mobile phone is loaded while updating or is located near a loader , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may be switched on half way and this could lead to a break@@ through of the update . &quot;

Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Alten@@ zentrum ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft have merged under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new start at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; besides consult@@ ations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation falls down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice receive information on questions such as care insurance or for the services of the health and care facilities . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have confirmed with our ambul@@ ant nursing service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; not rarely many services of the coff@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft and civil hospital as well as for out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the advice , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the study was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as mask prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherap@@ eutic treatment . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the salon are ideally compl@@ ementary .
&quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot;

at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; also , Sam@@ t@@ gemein@@ de@@ Bürger@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ bänder , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the praxis on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympath@@ y at first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship started to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who currently under@@ takes its specialist training in the Ver@@ dener hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the Müller married the idea of pursuing his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
and so we agreed that the gar@@ bage cans bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , where he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen as a resident doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for as a home . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 500,000 Euros will receive the gar@@ bage cans as part of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) , as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in North German average practice , about 500 . &quot;
there is another practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s surgery , also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fields of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ are@@ well ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Mar@@ burg re@@ members . &quot;
a little melanch@@ ol@@ y sp@@ ines them after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; , &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
her husband compl@@ ements laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border checks are also high on our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; do . &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , too , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; the minister said . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept border @-@ free migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia poses &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ies
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would leave refugees in direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite so , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , however , is already heavily regulated as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could lay them up in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles ever met with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days , his country will reck@@ on with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously had mig@@ rated to the Hungarian border , were circul@@ ating towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday un@@ anim@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was , people wise to propose certain routes , &quot; N@@ either we can , nor do we do that , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been travelling around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually come to a somewhat further west @-@ west course for the post@@ pon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ oj@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you perform rig@@ orous checks in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partners have since then consistently witness@@ ing a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; at the moment , it would not be a very high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distribut@@ ing land cards on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia wars still not cleared min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der transactions on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators found a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison reveals that even those outside our borders are ultimately tr@@ apped , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

that is why this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds is good .
&quot; however , it is understand@@ able that everyone does not want to inform each of the tables , but after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still ins@@ ul@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people to open . &quot;

&quot; through personal experience confront@@ ing the subject , she read much literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe visited the aid of volunteers , she immediately reported to it and had been part of the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all trained carefully .
Angelika Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid can handle her job well with her experience and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ ination @-@ dependent .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning staff .
training for new employees is offered every two years .

&quot; Fed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
Fed@@ Ex records dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter and the sl@@ ate giant showed its profit margin on a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its soil transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , ending 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; despite the price increases , the lower prospect will amount to 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher charges for heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said , however , that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and because of growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides solid revenues when considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than those of the ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ ,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; the quarter , which ended on 31 August , earned Fed@@ Ex 692 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
earnings per share amoun@@ ted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share reported by the analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks expected analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has made a decline in international priority shipping , which made sales in its unit express shipping to the market . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was s@@ ank in freight business due to higher operating costs . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares reduced by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on her most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ins spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening about them at an end of the dist@@ orted , two @-@ story sitting room is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues shall set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision , which is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by un@@ parall@@ eled incen@@ tive due to the unprecedented rise of short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anx@@ ious to rein@@ force this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; apparently the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what is in@@ secure on itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Aver@@ age Value increased by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argue that a interest increase would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tight@@ ening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ els had said in spring and early summer that this year , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be required to raise the pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of last month after China has de@@ valued its currency .
D@@ ow Jones Industrial Aver@@ age value fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would indu@@ ce global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when to raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would take the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. emergency bank . &quot;
now he says that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in decision making . &quot;
but in the final effect the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; dissolved conf@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on the financial market movements that apparently do not link with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , un@@ authorised member of the Federal Open Market Committee , adopted for a interest rate , c@@ ited in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its loans by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as re@@ union in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest in interest because the markets exc@@ ite , &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds twice the mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should advance the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai marketplace ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried products , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and c@@ rock@@ ery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
to prepare a warm welcome not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 sequences .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a different lesson than at the right school . &quot;
Brasi@@ lian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in shocking ways how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ cking in breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation needed for mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ lon@@ ged gymn@@ asium building on Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was lo@@ wered without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; the committee , among other things , had made an application for a &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
the exception was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction .
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ er First and roof@@ top &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this makes us a wonder@@ fully large south roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; again , the roof incl@@ ination , which for energetic reasons - is different than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; in respect of the roof @-@ ti@@ lt - whereby the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council tends to be restri@@ ctive in the case of exemp@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project in the gymn@@ asium building : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym building at the sports centre is a community project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Coun@@ cill@@ or for testing . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ tz@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ tz@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees pull from Pei@@ tz@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; they see the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the county , confir@@ ming the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the super@@ visory board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ tz@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff should be informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , which was prepared to take the lead from October 1 , and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case yield a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the super@@ visory board agre@@ es to agree with the two houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in Pei@@ tz@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 when the currently ongoing refurb@@ ishment at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ates rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this I conclude . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called ton@@ ight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen Hit ton@@ ight .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite , but there is none . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener referred to a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and have something to do there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been sever@@ ely in@@ jured during their corn harvest in the afternoon by shots .
&quot; during super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the police officer det@@ ects .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a susp@@ ect led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ ution and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as active @-@ suspic@@ ious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old recorded on Tuesday evening , which was de@@ ed according to the indication , and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning after they did not arrive home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first bite on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in respon@@ dents in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances , there was eventually a suspic@@ ion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
&quot; the arrested , according to the authorities , admitted to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
the further investigation shall bring about the near@@ er circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ poor citizens around the last affordable dwell@@ ings .
&quot; in order to cover demand for affordable apartments , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction Law &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with , 14@@ 0,000 flats are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first emergency accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also necess@@ it@@ ates substantial short@@ com@@ ings in housing construction policy in recent years .
Germany will move an apartment defic@@ it from year to year .
&quot; currently there were some 77@@ 0,000 units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals stayed in large cities in apartment share rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults stayed for no longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the floo@@ ds on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; pro@@ poses a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incen@@ tives for social housing will be revi@@ ved .
&quot; this could be reno@@ un@@ ced to the tax rate tax , and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed dwell@@ ings can be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to Bün@@ dnis , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters from Kf@@ W is now well in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , 184 million euros had already been retri@@ eved more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could even be stopped .
refugees have free trial : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
&quot; there is practically no pass to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announced to permit transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia seeks to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the settlement of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fle@@ w to Croatia to get there from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station R@@ TL . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that entered into force on the same day make redund@@ ant asylum procedures in Hungary almost unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and tax@@ ies in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter any border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip hi@@ des other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ ef@@ ields are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , hardly any refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 366 days of attack .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws gover@@ n the over@@ coming and damage of the border fence as criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Sz@@ eg@@ ed southern border town . &quot;
the convic@@ ted im@@ prison sent@@ ences up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in practice , no one has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after an Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be deport@@ ed there .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood have been disman@@ tled and one of the det@@ ectors in the bor@@ der@@ line has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of their journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
Mayor on the border
&quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with the ti@@ dying , when suddenly ten people with travel officers were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; said Wern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set up the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but for her in Wern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the close of Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we have tast@@ ed the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with snack and drink . &quot;
&quot; we have said , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was natural for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers climb@@ ed from an ICE in a regional train toward Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany but still over the border . &quot;
the regional train was shut down before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a Zwei@@ br@@ ücken@@ lauf sport@@ lich - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures , our Federal Chancellor has officially admitted the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st circle of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ try will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; pun@@ ched land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the sustained flow of refugees and the coming winter , with us to make decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quar@@ antine &quot;
&quot; with the refugee provision , Konrad is able to fully do all the hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 Refu@@ ge@@ es , which came to Austria on Monday , was without great effort , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; Meister@@ leistung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad will calculate with a demand of 85@@ .000 quar@@ antine in the he@@ ur@@ ry year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 lod@@ gings have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide $ 15@@ ,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he already had discussions with the state leaders .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs good , &quot; said Ferry Tay@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will give a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; helping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of not@@ ation , it could not be that lod@@ gings have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the super@@ structure . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior on accommodation successful , Konrad justi@@ fies with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an , whom one does not speak the un@@ truth without further . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their count on three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , no opening of urban sports hall and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as those affected can currently under@@ go such measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the city boss critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) was on Monday the further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no longer any special moves with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , that Austria now also has controls on its borders , &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tr@@ aded IT group S &amp; T is set , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very outs@@ et , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square metres of resi@@ dual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent will be en@@ quiries . &quot;
lia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner inaugur@@ ated second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jutta &apos;s wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now got an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop towards the store , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long thought whether I should open a store , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cr@@ adle .
I am interested in most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist can &apos;t answer the last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is up@@ graded every outfit .
der Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Palat@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also ties with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalist equi@@ pping or g@@ aps g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stim@@ ulates the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire came from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the fo@@ ehn @-@ hair@@ style is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related over sevent@@ y corners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del fil@@ med a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous j@@ oss@@ ack , to which besides Tr@@ ump also belongs the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; though there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dently the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - zu &quot; &quot; High German : the An@@ gi@@ ver , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from trage@@ dy : their desire to return to home , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contr@@ asts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter the illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ der , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so so@@ aring . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family has ended with a visit something for the organ organ , which generally well arrived . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imag@@ ined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sag@@ a at the time of his grand@@ father in the US would have been as he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels Film , for whom Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , even in the US it awak@@ ens interest . &quot;

&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ ör@@ fer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;

&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise recorded an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capit@@ als compared to today 3@@ 39@@ .000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , on average , reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 349@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ ating father , who decided to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Plan@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e on average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 720@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Seat on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Seat will end at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute which couldn &apos;t manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana , Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have an un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , at the Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in biggest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have a ly@@ rical way out of why Wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become the game per@@ tain@@ er who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed the energies ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s Energi@@ es , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I &apos;ve thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; the One could be . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , W@@ ho@@ m W@@ ho@@ m should choose if not her , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have b@@ anned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby @-@ Liga @-@ Converter at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a P@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his embarrass@@ ed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ ts at a p@@ unt that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian gra@@ dient had hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after F@@ um@@ ble and later talked to the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ break 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

the Free vot@@ ers call for the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Autumn Fair in Groß@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger raised a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get dec@@ ep@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ ers is post@@ pon@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually quite other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ ers meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it did during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the Chief Executive cri@@ tici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we must become more man@@ age@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy in Groß@@ stadt does not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch is on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched a pilot attempt at 47 Sec@@ ond@@ ary schools for the pilot project &quot; Middle @-@ level plus , &quot; where an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ onal intermediate level of three to four years is tested - in the result it will take nine years to finish . &quot;
but Ai@@ v@@ anger does not go far enough .
&quot; the issue G@@ 9 needs to be acceler@@ ated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ es that want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.8 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;

4 People killed after polic@@ emen to shoot prot@@ esters on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police burst rubber feet into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ stra@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u capital . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , Chief Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , while some of you threw stones and fire bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber floors . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floor used , of which it is known that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ Occup@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confront@@ ations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al theme in Nepal which has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lators acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lators have voted this week for certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Art Center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for corresponding offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is coming to question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had purchased a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday res@@ ett@@ lement at the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several tr@@ ailers are further wor@@ rying - they fear the selling of their leisure market
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , gr@@ ass@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday res@@ ett@@ lement on the Small Sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interested client , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the Em@@ des Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went out of the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
some ten to twelve million euros of expensive under@@ tak@@ ings have been in the discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions to sea bu@@ d owners , who came to the meeting , arous@@ ed the images and new details about the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the marine owner and a member of the Board of Inter@@ ests , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that sur@@ passes all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other investig@@ ators that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase strongly : &quot; all bus charges must come , so that it will be reck@@ oned , &quot; said Martin Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are of the former inn is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Double Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( G@@ oog@@ l . O ) announced a double donation campaign aimed at bringing 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations , as they are escap@@ ing from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of the donation request on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus drives , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said , that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million on g@@ oogle.com / tar will be doubled to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data needs a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or o@@ besity surgery , use different methods to reduce the magn@@ itude of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , o@@ besity operations have proven efficient to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are sick o@@ bes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of o@@ besity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
average BM@@ I under those under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ solve the diabetes disease completely and partially at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to this , diabetes is only one percent and sometimes only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the blood pressure control , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better found in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also aver@@ aged average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was with o@@ bes@@ e people who under@@ went an o@@ besity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we are waiting too long until we bring people seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic alter@@ ations , which have strongly connected their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly noticeable in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ sight@@ ly at school @-@ times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa B@@ inder .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader asked to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ic studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the kill@@ ings are reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the US violent reaction moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of san@@ iti@@ zer inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ in control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube how te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
teen@@ agers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive dis@@ infection of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ft , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency call center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let loose any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry , frag@@ rant hanging inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be dr@@ unk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived at the emergency room .
&quot; doctors drow@@ ned her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; over alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario &apos;s women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade were planned in New York State to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; by providing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; ul@@ cer &quot; and had discipl@@ ined discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority .

&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the leader@@ boards .

they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;

&quot; I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it rises altogether .

Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the figures given by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .

&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could have form@@ ulate &quot; it could have form@@ ulate better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
&quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot;
&quot; an attempt at a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called into pel@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he attempted to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ k@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more de@@ pend@@ able tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master soccer player Ben Cous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , Cous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben cous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Stew@@ ards tried to pi@@ on@@ ate him and threatened to finish racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity @-@ department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race @-@ day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tail probe in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age acc@@ us@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you re@@ act and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to go up@@ stairs and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had let the bom@@ b go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to explo@@ it its stable . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ een months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art were sitting in a room with a man whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
has the RV@@ L react lou@@ dly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ levels of the trainer have set up with the long lasting cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led him that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Caviar , the race @-@ day treatment rule was &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day that was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man acc@@ urs@@ ed to pad@@ dle
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a crash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helic@@ opter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after it was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
&quot; the police said , the driver went on , without stopping , in order to help the in@@ jured rider . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy pro@@ poses ri@@ vals for claims on ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Sl@@ ackl@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Sett@@ ing &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson rep@@ lied that the Ar@@ bit@@ ters &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the High Storm victory in Sydney at Friday evening allowed .
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ ed comment to the Storm Team after his team had scor@@ ed the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Rugby League and said the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that they were focused only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team would conc@@ eal him confident , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; it always appears - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights than they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time again occurs during this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy hit Benn@@ etts the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and rem@@ inded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; te@@ di@@ ous &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening , and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so that they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved higher results than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are the breaks do and don &apos;t have any points of tension ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they talk to us , it means that in a phase we will still meet them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in the Pre @-@ Final at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; serve with a $ 200,000 deposit for drug abuse &quot;
&quot; a man who probably threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was fre@@ ed against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite an potentially life @-@ long sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the Adv@@ oc@@ ate from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the threat of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criminal off@@ ences , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the stat@@ ely explanation of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was fre@@ ed against damage deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport at the police daily and stops at an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house travels apart
a truck driver was seriously wounded on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had b@@ rak@@ ed in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ induced plan ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously in@@ jured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to attract p@@ ests to sm@@ iling pictures
a girl @-@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone , as this slept , managed to log into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of un@@ attached images of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ erts instantly her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for search for decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction , - that he was addi@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
he was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of r@@ ape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and cr@@ ying . &quot;
she also saw the im@@ pending pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having committed inno@@ cent images of children on June 14 , last year , and not to be a court hearing on March 24 this year . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual crimin@@ als , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael bl@@ amed the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was held in cu@@ sto@@ dy due to hear@@ ings to other still pending cases . &quot;
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up by the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs left out of fear of discovery and arrest the people multip@@ ly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been picked up over 1,000 refugees in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were at the foot of bridges and def@@ ences to the German side .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; following the German Federal Police Station , the Munich Central Station showed clearly more refugees compared with the weekend of Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; just until 8 : 00 , around 700 people were in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : clu@@ stering of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the southwest &quot;
met@@ eor@@ ologists war@@ n against stor@@ ms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong Deep is the out@@ age of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
violent stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , even until Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with goats from 60 to 90 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass does it : every two years the motor@@ ways at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is primarily a movement among the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were attribut@@ able to this segment , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( Public Days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra which will stand by dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive for it . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 990 Euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first three cylinder petrol engines are also included . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only available in five @-@ door versions . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault announces the fourth generation of his Astra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he comes as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan laun@@ cher wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s indications in 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 that can be seen at the I@@ AA .
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radi@@ ator grill was re@@ marked and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the up@@ loading Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI were also compl@@ ementary . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prison@@ er of the jurisdiction of the Te@@ gel which was lod@@ ged for months in a too small cell .
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally have a claim to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex prison@@ er was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , had now been on free foot , had been laid in a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; despite the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions of adher@@ ence to the Land of Berlin , his am@@ t@@ sh@@ af@@ ing complaint failed . &quot;
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and rejected the case for a renewed trial . &quot;
they see human dignity in@@ jured .
chamber of the chamber now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the ques@@ tion@@ able period , only a few days of holding days were decisive for compensation , a compensation was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional authorities often have strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; thus , in April she said to a prison@@ er of damages , because he was im@@ pris@@ oned in a cell in the nude . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , Karlsruhe also confirmed a decent housing in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin j@@ ails had come to the head@@ lines because of missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to fight @-@ fights , because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young men , 19 should fall away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry &apos;s For@@ ec@@ asts this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resolution in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it , and we are creating it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are held annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing will fall out of the rental agreement , and in order to apply these particularly favourable flats , refugees will also apply . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing will have to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest € 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and the Federal Ministry of State agree that there must be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is expected that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically according to their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turn : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a prohibition of employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the courts of residence , the asylum seek@@ ers were confin@@ ed to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the short@@ age of skilled workers , the view of the short@@ est of view is that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks therefore is based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt from the Royal Road to work integration .
&quot; Berlin School Auth@@ orities have found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for their root parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ cu@@ ffs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators exce@@ eds the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared in classes without knowledge of knowledge . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained instruc@@ tors , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age to them , says Beate St@@ inger from the Berlin School of Education . &quot;
the German student movement estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the studies - the only exception to now Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or murder do not receive any services after asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law , if they begin their studies . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , the latter does not get a b@@ af@@ o@@ ath , since it does not fall under the circle of the resident people . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this can be short@@ ened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this financing gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state of churches right to develop into a new state of religion . &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic Charity Association is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act for a decade .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignore the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti@@ rac@@ ism Convention , Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to previously expected refugees , means Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for MAN@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is calling for all line @-@ ups to be handed out immediately when regi@@ stering health cards . &quot;
provided services could later be reck@@ oned with federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able to acc@@ use so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er Act stipul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants get worse about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ting costs should not only be taken in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s offices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general hospitals in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ related disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors prof@@ ited from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the short@@ age of health , may even alle@@ vi@@ ate alle@@ vi@@ ation by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have developed a sophisticated education system , some refugees even are doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and require further tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Parap@@ et Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable are refugee children , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ ps and death fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , severe atro@@ phy and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill seek@@ ers in the social offices can provide an application for a psych@@ otherapy , however , processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , non @-@ lab@@ our@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw all age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the bricks winds blow@@ ing to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an and junior researchers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto stands the current stage of the Man@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
thus the gift is in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ ure cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family puts the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to record the Cu@@ ban duo . &quot;
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast should conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also intri@@ gu@@ ed with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint activity . &quot;

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like a little other and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read from the eyes as soon as possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the highest command thus : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pony stallion and one zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there is something for every visitor to be there .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all the heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst starting from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also com@@ promised by statements by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous deaths and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
&quot; last month , they had broken him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the democratic change Movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven opposition politi@@ cian SMS messages received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mug@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to disman@@ tle from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating computer and printers from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; expected job mining results in a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Chief Executive Officer , and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unity after separation . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in the 19@@ 30s to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to address traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated threat of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ ands in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs have been one of the most injuries days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a time period in which you have to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will walk through the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travel@@ ed to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need to take a small break @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al has clear favourites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inser@@ tion effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , where it was measured at the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never folded in ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy @-@ Show giving us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar portr@@ ay@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now dou@@ bt@@ less than ever has become , like su@@ icide rates among young men on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments with football pitch in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely refer back to explore fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the telephone past@@ oral care , I told me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened by themselves , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I am right with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone calls people in moments of desp@@ air as well ; the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; so if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the backdrop of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PSG to mal@@ fall Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ wards Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria hits the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to play in Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ wards Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commen@@ ced his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as a PSG player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scor@@ ed a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only increase the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ e career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scor@@ ed one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his breach in one of three changes in the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team on the weekend , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and , passing beautiful into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PSG was to achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG was sometimes on , with some wrong passes and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five attempts in the first half alone , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who transformed the Di Maria into a shooting , which was lo@@ wered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scor@@ ed his sixth session after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had ple@@ d@@ ged a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before sub@@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi found a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League that has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
GL@@ EN@@ COR@@ E coll@@ ects 2.5 billion $ from stock sales
&quot; mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by single resource prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its huge debt cancellation plan . &quot;
&quot; based in London , Gl@@ enc@@ ore said that it has sold new shares worth about € 1.6 billion to pay off its own deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggl@@ ing with falling raw materials , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of rights rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cor@@ es share price in trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 par on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.69 per cent higher . &quot;
&quot; GL@@ EN@@ COR@@ E had announced last week the 2,5 billion $ stock sale as part of the most comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half short@@ ened , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; in the morning , 49 people will reach the city administration in Weimar after a long run . &quot;
&quot; the refugees are from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;
the latest adv@@ ent is a six month old girl from Syria .
the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings Visit in Washington
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a visit to the US at the end of the month , confir@@ ming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and rev@@ oked President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosted by X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have held bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i have the opportunity to construc@@ tively join areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet in Seattle several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a number of controversi@@ al issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding the alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversi@@ al waters of the South Chinese sea . &quot;
440 hp sports car bor@@ row@@ ed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to meet a dream and gave himself a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the re@@ gen@@ ated highway then came the evil awakening .
&quot; with a company in Got@@ ha district , one can meet the dream of renting a V8 American sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 b@@ hp . &quot;
so this also did a 29 year old from Got@@ ha district .
on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream was then over and over .
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the spin on a wet track and drove into the guidance table . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Tran@@ sition to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago , just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for the FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion le@@ ague champion , two times champion champion , twice the World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was already standing in front of the European Championship in front of the European Championship . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explained why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contrac@@ ted Guardi@@ ola and I &apos;ve played a great EM .
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 was running with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king class triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on is playing variety in film@@ work
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ took the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the movie and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with animated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the ac@@ tress of The Mar@@ tian consolidated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te defeated by her white con@@ sul . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on resist@@ ed that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded over Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WHITE why it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact raci@@ al representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement was nation@@ wide and ur@@ ged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to resort discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter released an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation , or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot;
American Ninja Warrior &apos; Crow@@ ns 1st Champion
professional sports climb Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Br@@ itten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his pile of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the conduc@@ tive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Br@@ itten , although he first ended the course at all , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great gratu@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he is excited about any gru@@ dge .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received many awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same when they exchanged roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth relay ; the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak to Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a board of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive assistance , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inner and made three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year sever@@ ely , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ate tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first r@@ ents since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit match of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he made the whi@@ p well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( impact training ) , saw clearly better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three runners at the end of the seventh inner the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was faced with , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who missed a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth floor , the wall made a R@@ BI double with the c@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scor@@ ed the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed seller , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ aving . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled from the injury list before the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wished for , Hug@@ hes said , &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runner positions in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third captain Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers laid on in the second one achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not feel very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
Hug@@ hes was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count and scor@@ ed no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hug@@ hes came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez ex@@ pi@@ red because of injury to the throw @-@ school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ chez &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the injury list because of a shoulder pulling , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP will last Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four star@@ ts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the Tw@@ ins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are supposed to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people enriched in it will then be accommod@@ ated in temporary shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden ex@@ ited on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be accommod@@ ated temporarily .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen for the initial approval of the former government pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is cr@@ ashing before our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF .
&quot; Germany , too , did not send a return to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is so arranged , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the general director for public safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
specific numbers did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria through the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border checks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new approach to binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government wants to support the Länder in the initial and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and announced on the late Tuesday evening , after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Ministers of the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who bri@@ gh@@ ten protection , they also prof@@ ess this too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ eye view cannot remain in Germany too .
this view was squ@@ ee@@ zed in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor pointed out that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced to set up the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent the fact that tu@@ g@@ boats were trying to spread out the territory via Romania . Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , there were thousands of mig@@ rant workers on the road to the Greek border . &quot;
room son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us

the close researcher from observ@@ ations of the room son@@ ography &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
therefore the moon is stag@@ gering slightly on its way around the ring planets .
&quot; this exchange rate is only small , but still too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .
already longer it was known that under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ moon , sp@@ inning the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers united at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden oceans was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ab@@ stain from an offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama around a month .
&quot; an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duction of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; is likely to break four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ edit@@ ary loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must re@@ think now , &quot; said director General N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible obligation of a united professionals . &quot;
&quot; however , as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ en@@ ant . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot;
f@@ ighter Rubin oc@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training once a week after his brain shake .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to start training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent cl@@ ash at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bli@@ ster . &quot;
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line , he is often rather advised of them . &quot;
they contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy yet : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gan@@ ese but much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruit , thus supports ten@@ acity , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone does not say anything about how ri@@ pe the fruit is , so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; of course , they taste pure or sweet dishes . &quot;
but a man@@ go gives a special touch with sav@@ ory dishes .
it alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter flavor of some leaf sal@@ ads like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and game . &quot;
the US par@@ cel service U@@ PS presents up to 95@@ 000 aid for the Christmas business in the US .
&quot; the company has already started with the recru@@ itment of seasonal workers , distributed U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
mainly drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS shock@@ ed his staff for the holiday season by 95@@ ,000 instruc@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have had precau@@ tions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;
in 2013 delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to the par@@ cel services .

&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n partly blow@@ s through the p@@ amper@@ ing valleys . &quot;
&quot; following F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , wind@@ ings and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
on the night@@ side of the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blow@@ s up to Thursday morning in the fo@@ ehn valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even Or@@ kan@@ ae of over 120 km / h are possible in the mountains . &quot;

&quot; in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , a total of more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air looks out , in the wake of a cold front with powerful , partly sweat @-@ driven rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind e@@ ats strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures go far back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rem@@ inded that the Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es could only live in sec@@ rec@@ y their faith in the City of Pop@@ es for centuries . &quot;
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a welcome sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ ade .
his negative impressions may have reinforced him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against distr@@ actions .
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown crown is one of the main works , which Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs had formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it adap@@ ts to the respective topics , it may seem quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he was fascinated by several partners spont@@ ane@@ ously : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house , focusing on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther , each with a set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were ultimately the cause of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in in 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Mor@@ avian Or@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; since the education was already done with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I have tried to work up to bear myself again with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to contribute to more importance in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer inv@@ ade into the images , let them look , discover and feel the force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus alt@@ ep@@ ost hosted the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , which has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to fully grasp the Bible , but selected the most important , mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar Old Foundation . &quot;

&quot; plans made , place found , companies tas@@ ked to model petro@@ leum for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in politics and administration provided for inc@@ iner@@ ation , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus hill slo@@ ping up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the first municipal manager Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga uses a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football team respon@@ ds to the increasingly p@@ aired situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in dealing with the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on each individual , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sely . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and there the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and may want to help .
but the decisive crit@@ erion has to put the policy .
&quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Bay Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when it takes place on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor @-@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ usen sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to go away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; at the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 licenses have initiated their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will be providing 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the associations already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive head loses an eye in accident at accident
&quot; the leader of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent and then moved out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; c@@ ited the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , could follow his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was standing in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
it &apos;s important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ m@@ ish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ witter@@ ed a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was thrown out of the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as spare drivers for the two Stam@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Tor
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us , in the first group game of the Europa League , have definitely sm@@ ashed . &quot;
the national player will also be missing to the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only alter its trunk position on the re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller accepts the place of Chief keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football instructor praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , it will also deny the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany shall be a pioneer in the change of the car of technological pioneer . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transportation stres@@ ses among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio stations .
&quot; for testing new technology , a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , wherever necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
Germany wants to employ around internationally that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government plans to dedic@@ ate itself to a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically feasi@@ ble until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , traffic @-@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 30 years experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ in@@ isation de@@ acon comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 anticip@@ ate autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to complete control throughout the road . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the flowing traffic could still present 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; at the same time , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only strike in singles from September 25th to October 4th . &quot;
the final decision will be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to bring the title even without Timo , &quot; said Federal Parliament Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated single Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the ch@@ eckl@@ ist in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rem@@ inded the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also lacking , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ tran@@ gh@@ tist @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has attracted a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was hit by a sl@@ ackl@@ ing of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and after long treatment . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which , thanks to video proj@@ ections , look horri@@ fic . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the great star of the fashion scene , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he was putting men in sk@@ irts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18 , at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initial position towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sound@@ ed a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely over@@ looked works of man , who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ o@@ grapher overall art work for which much effort was carried out : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist was dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material have checked the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leder@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ tier vintage Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion@@ able walking attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught himself the throwing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as G@@ aul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were made in large quantities for customers , for example , they worked on blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ desp@@ ots Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early hours of the Pl@@ au@@ ener summit , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry and accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , bor@@ row@@ ed by past styl@@ istic eras , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not operate ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
&quot; with us , they have already made half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the Industry Association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the past 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken off . &quot;
private specialty shops and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively mark@@ eted through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , export , currently being transferred to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer is explained by the embroi@@ der@@ y bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Extr@@ enst@@ elle of the West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a gap between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter made the historical snow@@ ball head new .
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small cu@@ bes in some places . &quot;
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ßen were inspired : &quot; before I couldn &apos;t start with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball head for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region relate to the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers in the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ round@@ ings and who would like to have a sou@@ venir . &quot;
thus I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener summit .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; le@@ gends are not to be stir@@ red , but Disney is still in a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a re @-@ fil@@ ming but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic pa@@ edi@@ a girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director is already standing : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Command Group to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new spin @-@ off@@ s and driving reform will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ate market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents detector system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and making the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also take control of the powers transferred to the company and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilitates the application process . &quot;
the right to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activity and use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , and thus provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Organization Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system should be lifted for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that , on the basis of the current limit values , some 50 percent of the threads are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low stressed that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of sounds is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans that are strongly accum@@ ulating over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government is therefore cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously that &quot; &quot; already low quantities can especially cause nerve damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es that a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury also enters the environment through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants viol@@ ate more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two @-@ thir@@ ds of the total quantity in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; was c@@ ited out of paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish have already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
