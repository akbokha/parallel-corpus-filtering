&quot; in view of this expertise , the institutes agree to take a game of clo@@ cks or movements from a Swiss company and a company belonging to the community , which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements . &quot;

&quot; C ) At the request of the Community , the organisation is prepared to examine the data which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the Community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not require the organisation to become material superf@@ lu@@ ous , provided that it remains accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the Community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation ob@@ tains the consent of the Community and States to the designation of inspec@@ tors for states .
&quot; II ) Acc@@ ep@@ ts the Community either against a proposed designation or at any time against a subsequent designation , the organisation of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative en@@ closures . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council will discuss the refusal after the General Director of the Organization - in the following - addressed the purpose of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization may actually fulfil their duties according to their agreement .
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subordin@@ ated to the inspection are as small as possible ;
( II ) The protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of confidential information is guaranteed .
&quot; each State applies to the Organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention are concluded with regard to core material when the community and the organisation realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for nu@@ kle@@ ar action , which has become less profitable under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community notes the transfer of core material from the states subject to the security measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated with regard to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the restoration of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to safegu@@ ards under this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community agrees with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures according to this Convention can be terminated with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be used as long as the core material is used in such activities .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis over the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on any passing on of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a knowledge of military activity , nor does it refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the Organization , the Community and the States bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or persons subject to their sovereign authority , however , shall bear extraordinary costs as a result of a special organization of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se the costs , provided that it has been agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , on the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the States nation@@ als . &quot;
any claim that the community or state towards the organization or the organization towards the community or a state for damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident caused by the implementation of the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council shall verify that the organization must not be able to verify itself by veri@@ fying that no core material , which must be subject to security measures under this Convention , may reimbur@@ se the reports envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account what mass has been achieved through the applied safety measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to inqu@@ ire that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the State concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , which shall not be submitted in the negotiation process or by another by the Organisation , Community and States , upon request of a party which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named judges elect a fifth who pres@@ ides over . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within three days of the application , the community or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint those arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the designation or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; II ) If the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply their security measures with regard to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the Community and the States consult one another on request of one of the contracting parties on a change of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organisation , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall promptly inform all Member States of the Organization of any change in this Convention .
this Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures for the entry into force are completed .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Con@@ tract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this section of the Convention is to set the procedures necessary in carrying out the provisions of part I on securing measures as required .
&quot; the aim of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear materials of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a junction by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; in order to obtain the target set out in Article 28 , the material reserve is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ m with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity which is not proven for a certain period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the given amounts .
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the Organization shall make full use of the security system of the Community after Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Core Material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
&quot; in applying its security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are useful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and report system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in the processing of ore .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle under the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the community of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material which is suitable for the production of fuel or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not available , however , the community believes that the recovery of core material , the securing measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the association agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , of these security measures , provided the entire material quantity delivered in the states at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material consisting of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with the provisions of this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the Organization supplementary agreements which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the completion of these agreements with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention enters into force . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report stated in article 62 , the organisation provides a consolidated inventory of the core material underlying the security measures of this convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ loss problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the EEC submitted a table which is evident in what manner it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds , which the Member States will contribute to the special financial account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account will be separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ paid notes of the Member State , which are to be paid in the currency of the respective state to order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited in the deposit of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( although i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines stipulated for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Each Member State may make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator reserves the right to pay approximately proportional bills to the cash or the school j@@ owl in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ approval ; and
VII ) The extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices funded by ordinary funds of the organization , with the aim of ad@@ am@@ ble to be taken into account in the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction must not be used instead of sub@@ stan@@ tive funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which are generally valid for the development loan granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years in each case in 50 years . &quot;
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this cash @-@ clock are directly linked to the organization that it retains .
&quot; each special transaction loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the funds is stated . &quot;
&quot; recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services produced or rendered ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who , according to the stipul@@ ations of what the car@@ et@@ aker defined at the time of loan granted , may be the recipient of a special action loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions are made to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred from the administrator to the respective Member State as soon as possible . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker is informed of the E@@ WG by the directors in preparation for the full assignment of all the special transaction loans and the plans and programs approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator supervis@@ es the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account decision .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC transferred as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special financial account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made out of the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid out of the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action sheets , and on any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may agree on , the agreement and all obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the special transaction loan granted by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; considering the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment to the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issued the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ ING : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of carrying out the associations envis@@ aged in Article 2 of this Agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are called &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the promotion of the personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , which accepts it . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose objective is within the scope of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the organs involved in carrying out the association provided in Article 2 of this Agreement are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the setting up of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - To monitor the development of research work , and to guide the best possible outcomes consistent with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates - in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , who has the information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with respect to all research and development activities on which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts their T @-@ ness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the scientific and technological developments in the world to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representative in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking this . &quot;
&quot; advis@@ ors , who provide the VG research proposals with a view to ensuring the best possible scientific results approved for the Eur@@ atom Programme , take this task with regard to all research and development work referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and which is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , shall carry out this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;

&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which offer the best possible use of the resources , staff and the knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , are subject to this task in relation to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a core and energy research representative of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of the future programmes and defining their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the board of directors , advis@@ ors and coordin@@ ating committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the VG &apos;s opinion on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the area of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties act on the works of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies that are created for the purposes of this agreement .
&quot; Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom Programme , according to this agreement , is set annually to an amount that is cont@@ ested by Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint venture as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland sur@@ passes J@@ ET to the Common Enterprise J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Joint Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same base that is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year , which amount is fores@@ een to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payments mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set out in Annex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom is exemp@@ t from duties or other duties and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion financial accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned , for which application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the credits as well as with their possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before one month after the conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those transactions carried out at the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ S has to obtain the required funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate at the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could conclude a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .

&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community is necessary for them to negotiate and close the regional agreements envis@@ aged in this Convention , as far as these agreements are governed by the Directive 79 / 4@@ 09 / EEC in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Community . &quot;
the conclusion of the Convention by the Community - without prejudi@@ ce to the legal acts which it succ@@ eeds in later - is not an extension of the exclusive responsibilities of the community .
&quot; because of the particular situation of Greenland with regard to the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exemp@@ ted from the scope of the Convention . &quot;
the Convention on the Conservation of Mig@@ r@@ atory Wild Anim@@ als is approved in the name of the European Economic Community .

&quot; den@@ ounce the ever growing value of wild animals from environmental , ecological , genetic , scientific , aesthetic , free @-@ time , cultural , educational , social and economic point of view ; &quot;
&quot; in particular concern about the species of wild animals , the hikes over the national jurisdiction @-@ boundaries or outside the same companies ; &quot;
&quot; in the realization that States are the prot@@ ectors of the mig@@ r@@ atory species of animal and must be , who live or cross in their national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; convinced that conservation as well as effective le@@ ge and use of mig@@ r@@ atory species require joint action of all states , in whose national jurisdiction these types spend part of their life cycle ; &quot;
recommendation 32 adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Environment of Man ( Stockholm 1972 ) and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly with satisfaction to the informed action programme -
&quot; ( 1 ) In the sense of this agreement a ) &quot; mig@@ rating species &quot; means the total population , or a ge@@ ographi@@ cally defined sub @-@ population of any species , or any lower tax@@ on of wild animals , of which an important share is cycli@@ cal and predictable one or several national jurisdiction boundaries . &quot;
&quot; B ) means &quot; &quot; preservation of a mig@@ r@@ atory species &quot; &quot; the tot@@ ality of the influence acting on this wander@@ ing type , which could affect its long @-@ term distribution and population size ; &quot;

the Parties of the Convention on the implementation of Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement - herein@@ after referred to as the Convention
&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and on the wish expressed by the Committee for Trade talks at its meeting of 11 . and 12 April 1979 , an expressed desire to arrive at a uniform version of an agreement on the implementation of Article VII of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement , &quot;
&quot; in view of the fact that Article 27 of the Convention concerning Chan@@ ges has not yet entered into force , &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) of the Convention ;
&quot; 2 . recognise that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this agreement for developing countries may be insufficient for five years in accordance with Article 21 , paragraph 1 in practice for some developing countries . &quot;
&quot; in such cases a development country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ iry of the period specified in Article 21 paragraph 1 . &quot;
&quot; 3 . recognise that developing countries that are currently carrying out customs clearance on the basis of legally established minimum values , if necessary , want to make a reservation to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions to which the contracting parties agree to be retained ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . acknowledge that developing countries , who are of the opinion , revers@@ ing the order of application at the application of the introduction in accordance with Article 4 may cause actual difficulties , the desire to make the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot;
the government of : ... reserves the right to stipul@@ ate that the relevant provision of Article 4 is only applicable if the customs authorities apply the application to the application of Article 5 and 6 in reverse order .
&quot; developing countries such a reservation , so the parties agree to this reservation in accordance with Article 23 of their agreement ; &quot;
5 . recognise that developing countries may have the desire to make the following reservation under article 5 paragraph 2 :
&quot; the Government of ... reserves the right to stipul@@ ate that Article 5 ( 2 of the Convention shall be applied in accordance with the relevant note , even if the complain@@ ant has not submitted a corresponding request . &quot;
&quot; developing countries such a reservation , so the parties agree to this reservation in accordance with Article 23 of their agreement ; &quot;
&quot; 6 . recognise that some developing countries have expressed concern that in the implementation of Article 1 of the Convention , problems can arise as far as they refer to single representatives or single @-@ group imports into their countries . &quot;
the parties agree that in case of occurrence of such problems in the practice in developing countries that apply the Convention on the request of these countries an investigation of this question is carried out in order to find suitable solutions ;
&quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 acknow@@ le@@ dges that customs administr@@ ations must carry out investigations , if necessary , in order to convince themselves of the correctness or accuracy of information , declarations or documents that were submitted for customs clearance . &quot;
&quot; they also agree that the article recognis@@ es that investigations can be carried out , with which , for example , to verify whether the values given to the Cust@@ oms in connection with customs clearance are complete and correct . &quot;
&quot; they acknowledge that contracting parties , subject to their domestic legislation and procedures , have the right to count on the full participation of the introduc@@ tions in these investigations ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
&quot; I encourage myself to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the actual quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and / or is executed in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community is entitled to safeguard the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the community market has not been affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; at the entrance of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 in accordance with the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total volume stated under number 2 will be determined on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community is meeting arrangements so that the shipments of ven@@ tional residues in frozen meat are not under@@ mining the shipments of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs can only be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that , within the quantities specified in this agreement , there are licensing lic@@ ences for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the granting of import licenses for the aforementioned products , originating in Argentina , is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods can be disp@@ at@@ ched .
&quot; in addition , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community is notified in regular intervals the amounts communicated to the export licenses ; these data may be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed for destination country , if necessary . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the hammer - , lamb - and goat @-@ meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat will be executed under the agreement not named in accordance with the agreement . &quot;
the Committee discusses all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &quot;
&quot; I encourage myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and , in particular , for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I encourage myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement , for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal he@@ el of his H@@ amm@@ el and lamb di@@ lig@@ ently is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure a flaw@@ less operation of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the actual amount of the year actually did not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the given quantities are executed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the community assures that New Zealand will not be prevented from using new technological developments or perpet@@ u@@ ating its competitive position on the market of the Community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee above mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community is entitled to safeguard the protection clause , it under@@ takes to protect the New Zealand interests resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ax rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changed the quantities determined in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ of rate called in clause 5 is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total volume stated in clause 2 will be determined on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tonnes of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the Community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community is meeting arrangements so that the paragraph of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mining this goal due to the implementation of the Regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creative workers in the community without risk for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs can only be taken into account with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the granting of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority named by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods can be disp@@ at@@ ched .
&quot; in addition , the relevant authority of the Community shall notify the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals for export licenses ; these data may be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed in accordance with the country of destination . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly examines the tendency on the hammer - , lamb - and goat @-@ meat market of both contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed according to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee considers all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to it by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contractual parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount set out in clause 2 is valid for the period from January 1 to December 31 , 2015 . the volume of this agreement reached by the entry into force of this agreement will be set in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the New Zealand &apos;s main area on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement entered into force on 20 October 1980 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by both contracting parties before 1 April 1984 in view of changes they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I ad@@ ore myself to propose , if your government can agree to the preceding , that this letter and your reply form together an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I encourage myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are prepared at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tis which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix in a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standards preparation in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to carry out written records of all stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are stored in the laboratory as long as possible , until some likel@@ ihood may be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; every single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen if the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot;

sera of the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer at the same time . &quot;
&quot; a serum for use on object carriers in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be inferior to the ant@@ ei@@ ous antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals that can be immune by blood cells or specific substances of group A .

&quot; it is desirable that on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE statement that without a change in Article 13 of the present Convention , the date of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain uns@@ af@@ e - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Con@@ ventions , &quot; paragraph 1 is given as follows : &quot;

&quot; B . each state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this Protocol under paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of soil , but also allows for the exploitation of land which does not permit any other planting , and even for extensive management , which is the main part of today &apos;s production , favour@@ ably responding to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that from its cultivation it will depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which , in turn , depend entirely on the measures to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producers themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and olive groves represent essential raw materials in the areas in which olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harvest and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , this causes all particular difficulties which seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in the countries where olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary significance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular the olive growing countries currently under development ; &quot;
