&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal sen@@ timent . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are also degra@@ ded as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this affects signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole seems to be primarily a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that arith@@ me@@ tic is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , which prevents recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were suffering from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with half @-@ operated patients , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , to avoid re@@ occurring , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with the use of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in reducing symptoms than patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes with previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal mal@@ functions , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , head@@ ache , blur@@ red vision , loss of s@@ ali@@ va ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and mild to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption as well as for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the launch of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and related man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l .
symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia treated with A@@ bili@@ fy should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be withdrawn . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es , it should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of ster@@ ber@@ izing compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to deterior@@ ating glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to comb@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metast@@ ases .
&quot; if one considers the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose of dosage prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ sy@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for people and because of the concerns arising in the animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l , a total decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with half @-@ sur@@ geri@@ es ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under half @-@ operation i@@ dol @-@ treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term growth phase of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and about whose occurrence is also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose is of benefit because Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma mass binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ test . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in week 52 , in a semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operative dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ l showed a placebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a re@@ taining effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo considering prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ wer@@ age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l in extensive Met@@ abo@@ lic Met@@ abo@@ lism over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a stimulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects comprised a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can use the melting tablets as an alternative to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases , after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l injection solution and started using Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l &apos;s oral application . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and to minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the to@@ del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by revers@@ ing of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
&quot; in the event of par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or il@@ lic@@ it drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to deterior@@ ating glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly used as one @-@ time in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly while maintaining the same time as the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;

&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose of dosage prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects were more commonly referred to ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) in clinical trials ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term growth phase of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l compared with 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ gi@@ tis / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ geri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) involving 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ ese reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in week 52 , in a semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and half @-@ sur@@ geri@@ es 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Depres@@ sions Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extended by man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l showed a superior approach to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % greater the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies of healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ stro@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for precau@@ tion , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expos@@ ures , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; they have only limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects comprised a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters formerly had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a single dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in comparison to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to efficacy indicators such as time until the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the introduction of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease has failed , and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for dosage recommendations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out in patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data to recommend dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have far more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ ry number has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly identified immune toxic@@ ity has not been detected in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and sti@@ cky remedies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child is born . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised to have a lock service before the treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) which can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who once were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , head@@ ache , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot;
&quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive , related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active that promotes the mat@@ ur@@ ation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ ym@@ eri@@ zation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans @-@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ mare receptor and is due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ated protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed , non @-@ allied studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial study . &quot;
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an impaired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in analog@@ y to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or transmission of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values following a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Clear@@ ance was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metabo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic agent and as in other potentially toxic substances it should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , a sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution . &quot;
&quot; after a complete addition of the solution , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot;
then the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should be sw@@ ung slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until complete pul@@ sation of the powder is carried out .
&quot; if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle has to be inver@@ ted gently , in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to the application . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market prior to market launch is provided by medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Educ@@ ational brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes are provided for transport by patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood ei@@ sen@@ ic values , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood donation and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein for patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to perform their own blood don@@ ors .
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ lack or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in administration , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene in a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they either were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems were uph@@ eld in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed has been demonstrated in compliance with the European Union &apos;s regulations , that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals across all member states , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted its approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the transfer of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is caused by the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger operating procedures that require a large blood volume substitute ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
&quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and fol@@ lic@@ as may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be kept from 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in attachment has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , so that large iron reserves are available before the on@@ set therapy begins . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medication into the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop under treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lism ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , is contra@@ indicated in the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa on the following pre@@ - , companion or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ ot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and h@@ amm@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te index ) , is decreased ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte @-@ numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and investigate the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis able , is not accelerated the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered for the evaluation of therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment taking into account the patient &apos;s involvement that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia , thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , patients were reported under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients undergoing treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ zed and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese did not influence .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 , patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ st@@ osen . &quot;
survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the patient . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies consistently , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and at inspections .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20@@ x of the weekly dosage recommended for humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced flying body weight , a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase of the fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples that are of uncertain Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for clinical situations .
&quot; within the scope of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum period of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued @-@ on tab , so that , if necessary , the dimensions of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
23 In case of maintenance therapy the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .

&quot; prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorisation has to provide the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and , in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as it is used in the drug . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for the marketing authorisation under@@ takes to conduct the studies listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as described in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and in accordance with each subsequent update of the risk management plan adopted by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human use , &quot; simultaneously with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with the receipt of new information that may have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or measures to reduce risk reduction • within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction concerned ) mil@@ estones • after request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
• suffer a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first appearing or increased chest pain ) - the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) occurs - if such a blood drop occurred in the past for example .
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the vascular diseases ( vascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which re@@ forms again with further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( h@@ amm@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before commen@@ cing the therapy . &quot;
&quot; very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ state medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia will be best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated due to an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically open cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis able , is not accelerated the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ y@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed affects blood cells as a growth factor and may have a negative effect on the tumor under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood ar@@ tery ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time prior to surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to spray ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral bleeding , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ isms ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

&quot; if a sy@@ ringe is taken from the fridge and room temperature has been reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture as with the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with disease Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion , or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , which de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s manufacturer provides informative material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis . it contains information on how to use the medicine as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the launch of Ac@@ last@@ a in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When rel@@ ap@@ sed to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group . &quot;
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on the safety and efficacy are missing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a before the start of the therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ c@@ emia can develop , whose maximum is usually occurring within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients requiring dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which expressed itself as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area were diagnosed , especially in cancer patients , over oste@@ opor@@ osis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area at one with Ac@@ last@@ a and a patient treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ c@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the hip as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower radius by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology In the treatment of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vis after the third annual dose . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the trab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the trab@@ ecular bone architecture . &quot;
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ last@@ a reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the original value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment increased BM@@ D in comparison to placebo treatment at all times . &quot;
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % at the shr@@ ank .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ annual dose of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in relation to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in the disease of the disease Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , particularly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain relief was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the big cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ al Eli@@ min@@ ation period of 1 ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early phases of the separation ( α and β with the above 2 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease in z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
a decreased clear@@ ance of metabo@@ li@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients . &quot;
the result is that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; since there are only limited data for serious ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C that the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects with other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ ption of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
Ac@@ last@@ a is supplied as a package with a bottle as a package or as bund@@ ling package consisting of 5 packs that each contain one bottle .
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • Con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ation in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smo@@ kers and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When rel@@ ap@@ sed to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk Management Plan The holder of the marketing authorisation holder comm@@ its to conduct the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , set out in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; dimin@@ ished blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get &apos;s mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ last@@ a along with foodstuffs and beverages , please ensure that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss Ac@@ last@@ a , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls , consider the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at present it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; drow@@ sin@@ ess , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , stomach upset , inflammation , redness , redness , redness , redness , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , transi@@ ent increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue leak@@ age and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , a short @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients have to be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ c@@ emia can develop , whose maximum is usually occurring within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or • the over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that one or more I &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? it The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable at the same time applying A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a drug for application in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
&quot; it is used in patients who need health and not cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
it is an addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) that have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported by up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other related persons ) are advised that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in treating patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied , is believed that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; over@@ weight patients as well as in patients with an obesity have studied , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that occurred under treatment in placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a materi@@ ality study , in which a limited number of persons were given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ compli@@ a compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg , CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg , and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ compli@@ a and placebo -@@ 4,@@ 2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in comparison to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with an obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 among placebo I
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .

improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

&quot; patients with black skin colour can hold up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x , and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as a patient of other ethnic populations . &quot;
n popular pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic field , were considered potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases seems to be the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions associated with proced@@ ural stress as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on fertility or cycle dysfunction were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diab@@ etic medication ( dual therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be adequately controlled with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the on@@ set of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin is to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c factor , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin accounted for a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other constitu@@ ents , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one levels - in blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the launch of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be led up to the prec@@ ursor of the laboratory parameters from the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can flow from fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative control studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , or as a dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but reas@@ oned doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients talk about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment may be suspended ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies to investigate interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ pl@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( this data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the tumor and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ an@@ asc@@ ents were often more common than placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ ides .
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency has rarely been reported under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to act via activation of specific nucle@@ i @-@ recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the event of an insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ ven@@ ci@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy was continued for more than two years in order to investigate the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the on@@ set of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin for three months , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents was consistent in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and minor but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plastic matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies demonstrated that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a smaller extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance resem@@ ble itself . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and recur@@ rent ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ pl@@ in@@ emia resulting in gest@@ ation dimin@@ ishes and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces resulted in increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ven@@ ties were investigated . &quot;
in clinical studies more than 1 year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents showed in comparison to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both about an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medi@@ ations , there was an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both for tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in clinical trials in which pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was compared with other oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics or placebo ( non @-@ drug @-@ free tablets ) , women ( but not in men ) , who took pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , showed a higher number of bone frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if there is a dose adjustment in the patient when switching to Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always for other medicines taken by them .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dys@@ functions of brain function and even death .
nervous system diseases - Peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Jel@@ ly - li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection site can arise a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
&quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during insulin therapy can occur in local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system Gel@@ der@@ ually - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic e@@ dem@@ a , breathing difficulties , lower blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can however be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral influ@@ x of glucose or sugar @-@ based foods .
&quot; therefore , diab@@ e@@ tics should always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help block or by glucose that is intraven@@ ously given by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular danger to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane water bottle is extracted from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always for other medicines taken by them .

before each injection • Check that at least 12 units of insulin are left in the cartridge to ensure an even mixture .
follow these steps to avoid injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle up • tap a few times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
&quot; if air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue to keep Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ strich up with the injection needle , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( figure D ) • Now you have to leave a drop of insulin out of the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Pu@@ t the cap again on the ready pen so that the digit 0 is compared to the metering mark ( Figure E ) • Control , whether the pus@@ h@@ button is pressed completely . &quot;

&quot; if the press is not able to move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap will show 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outward , while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the quantity on the cap directly next to the metering mark • Note the highest number you can see on the pressure knob • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have adjusted a wrong dose , turn the cap head forward or backwards until you have set the correct quantity of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise insulin is removed from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , take the following steps : &quot;
then remove the cap and put them in such a way that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during injection . • Ke@@ ep the pus@@ h@@ button after the injection completely squee@@ zed until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely and then proceed as described before use • P@@ ossi@@ bly , when pressing the push button , you will hear a cli@@ cky sound . &quot;
you may not adjust dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual amounts scale to estimate how much insulin is still left .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must first be absorbed , then the amount of the long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level still exceeds 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic attacks . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , where 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients once daily received 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea , nausea , nausea , nausea , nausea , and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardiac complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum har@@ n@@ acid acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety were not yet fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ vol@@ uted con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ saw medications , it can lead to acute toxic@@ ity during the treatment , because the lowering of the serum har@@ n@@ saw can first mobili@@ ze ur@@ inary acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is in rare cases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ic ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous offering of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study of subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x used a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that simultaneous sei@@ z@@ ure containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data via a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be related to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiac events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ Group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ ic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 study ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information . &quot;
the subsequent treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short @-@ breath , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , skin l@@ esi@@ on , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te count , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabo@@ li@@ smus and arises as part of the reactions as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum concentrations were &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the start of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the commonly used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs 80 mg &quot;
&quot; the lowering of the serum har@@ n@@ saw to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained over the entire treatment . &quot;
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dysfunction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the response of the serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum har@@ n@@ acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a gi@@ cht@@ sp@@ urt in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the not@@ ch size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ out nodes up to 24 months . &quot;
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ ie / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional after administration . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum concentrations was observed , provided that was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma de@@ binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ Mark@@ ed F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency following the intake of multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at changed not in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g of t / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe ni@@ gh@@ tening function .
12 liver function limitation Accor@@ ding to multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ pu@@ gh classification B ) the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transitional cellular pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , in about 11 @-@ times exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine composition and are not considered relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which accounted for about 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ologic studies on bearing rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4,@@ 3 times and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 , is ready before the drug is put into circulation and is available as long as the drug is put into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
in some people the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
&quot; inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a cancer or the read @-@ Ny@@ on syndrome ( a rare inn@@ ate condition in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , hyper@@ sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is clari@@ fied before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be in any case , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data derived from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than with those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that indicates , that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal disorders ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , de@@ con@@ ges@@ tion ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , de@@ con@@ ges@@ tion ( swal@@ lowing abdominal pain ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic digestion . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other constitu@@ ents AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd to appro@@ ve the adoption of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there should be a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were rarely reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ bul@@ king heart@@ burn or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported rarely ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
there are no data available which indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning with each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ sion .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before commen@@ cing the therapy .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are reported by cancer patients but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; nevertheless , the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum - phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 8.@@ 8 % in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the con@@ tender . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6 % ) was reached in comparison to placebo ( 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients experiencing one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued to hold ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was also maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ y trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo ( 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes 1 mg / kg in soft tissue after an intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substance was eliminated within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; according to IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing not exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not secre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; in the case of radio@@ active striking vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the f@@ ec@@ zes after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

Ad@@ vaginal f is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , with the use of Ad@@ junc@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a period of one year ( for example , for examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a restart of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investigated how Ad@@ vaginal f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; for patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ ous antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents , Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , as the Ad@@ vaginal dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood mirror regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable as tal@@ low , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
&quot; careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post transplan@@ t phase . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low clearance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal dosage can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow an oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be inj@@ ected intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adol@@ escent therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient following the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adol@@ escent therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal f , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose , must be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin once a day for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ t With adult patients , which are converted to Ad@@ vaginal f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ ted patients , received Pro@@ gra@@ f in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood tal@@ k@@ asses in the target range can be a reduction in the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol , a calculation of cre@@ atine in@@ takes and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of seb@@ um in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s blood @-@ level mirror should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal f , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ van@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tac@@ tile level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in the wake of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Ad@@ vaginal ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ cal concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a syndrome referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ cal blood levels while simultaneously receiving substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer , which is why the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabo@@ li@@ zed with medicines which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism does not affect metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ inflation of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
&quot; the side effects are performed following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; as is known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases are frequently increased in patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BC @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis able . &quot;
&quot; active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependen@@ cy of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Ad@@ vaginal and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Ad@@ vaginal arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed rep@@ ul@@ sion or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the adult group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) , 15.@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Ad@@ vaginal C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Ad@@ vaginal vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f , twice daily , after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who had undergone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ ts for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplantation , the bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequently observed after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) in the first year after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mes@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s ob@@ liter@@ ate compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ati@@ et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ al ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ transplantation A multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised trial Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional donation of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to descent reflections between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the Un@@ bound Group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , leaving ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly through bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients en@@ cir@@ cled by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at the average daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;

advances are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or preventing bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called &quot; &quot; Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate &quot; , &quot; but it is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new arter@@ ies with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transfer of lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period shall not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat the inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections should be recommended for proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the delivery speed should be directed to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the case of previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ rate ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post @-@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the clear@@ ance rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was observed after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in the previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE dealt with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were occasionally reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ids in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on previously untreated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously untreated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breasts , the brain , bones or soft tissue ( tissue that connects and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself , thus trig@@ gering infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene , which is not broken in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs was in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s responses to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based upon examining the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in Inj@@ ection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Com@@ passionate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly releases over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main factors were the alterations of the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who alone took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other constitu@@ ents , against in@@ toxic@@ ated active substances or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze must also not be used in patients who suffer from a con@@ genital hyper@@ tension ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , or have an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued approval to the company SP Europe for the transfer of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dropping the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient collective and the data did not suff@@ ice to give appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treating patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials involving des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in@@ hibited in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies yiel@@ ded no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ial processes . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , ag@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il @-@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin onto end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage may cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ a@@ qui@@ valent was for exposure after a dose of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gene toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and wet or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the gin@@ gi@@ val pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the patient &apos;s history ( respiratory system due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze following symptoms or diseases : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ ache or reinforcement of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if applied in the recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduced attention . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze as you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately , if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose on time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; heart pal@@ pit@@ ations or cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , increased physical activity , redness , flus@@ hing , nas@@ al bleeding , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , pain or difficulty passing urine , nose irrit@@ ation , ch@@ ills , reduction of odor @-@ sen@@ ess , con@@ spic@@ uous h@@ ep@@ atic values , rest@@ lessness , anxiety and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness , cor@@ p@@ ses , it@@ ching , hi@@ ck@@ skin , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash were reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or w . &quot;
&quot; in a total of eight studies , A@@ eri@@ us was examined with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by measuring the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the no@@ od@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after 6 weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe for the launch of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; once daily , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occur@@ ing of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the present disease procedure and can be completed after the symptoms have ended and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms have been removed .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo , were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered .
&quot; this includes in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin onto end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses given in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified as an alternative to inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ically I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ inf@@ eri@@ fication is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria a@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in vi@@ vo , not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed , in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnos@@ ing . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabo@@ li@@ ze dis@@ or@@ adi@@ ene and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed - is identical to that in children who metabo@@ li@@ ze normal . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup @-@ group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered .
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily average dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the progression of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or disturbances in adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither an ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced power loss nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us Tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria a@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are limited in the metabolic rate . &quot;
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher and the C@@ MA@@ X is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life time of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ided bottles with a child @-@ proof polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations to take with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take once daily in the mouth , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate can be taken out without damaging it . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was apparent . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

an a@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablet once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the assimil@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable for adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take up were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , however , in combination with the dosage studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

an a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melting tablet once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the assimil@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take up were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed - is identical to that in children who metabo@@ li@@ ze normal . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , there were no adverse events observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be allergic to inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ a@@ qui@@ tin study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
in various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients with recommended doses compared to those of adults who received the des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company re@@ jects its application for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane sleeve of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are participating in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ per@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , ag@@ ro@@ ost@@ asis reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of infection and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medi@@ cam@@ ent , with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or modi@@ fying the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under ag@@ id@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; children reduced the viral load in children , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine a@@ Gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load decreased after four weeks with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 Asp@@ erg@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs , which are broken down just as am@@ ic@@ ase and are harmful to health at high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ eg@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ parti@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were over the risks .
&quot; gener@@ ali@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; it was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to be approved by Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ stri@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ b@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ ar as capsule , which is why as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ parti@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ id@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ parti@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; it is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ id@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ ro@@ ost@@ asis may not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ parti@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with chronic liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generators and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides , which are metabo@@ li@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ sor of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of can@@ v@@ ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in ,
&quot; in patients who take these drugs at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be examined on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ Gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
aging should be set in duration 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous kut@@ an hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active substances are metabo@@ li@@ zed above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % is reduced if Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amalg@@ am avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended close supervision , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but because of the f@@ anta@@ sic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ parti@@ asis will be at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
&quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot;
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in adverse side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , among them substrate , inhibit@@ ors or In@@ duc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be examined for toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants , known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the Am@@ pren@@ ra@@ viol@@ r plasma level . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ il , may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; con@@ gest@@ ing simultaneously increases their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) more than 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ inated cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dosing of ven@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected to be expected at the same time by ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; because plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ om@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ e@@ oly@@ sis is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased at the same time as am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma level around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be examined on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if Am@@ pren@@ ar is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether amalg@@ am viol@@ ates in humans into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a re @-@ production study of gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ par@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1,@@ 200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and peripheral fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( spi@@ kes ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients were found ( 3 % ) in comparison with 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ car@@ b@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ ar had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ par@@ ase twice a day with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable ; one exception formed increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K levels , which in patients who received am@@ at@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate the necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ on@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral , g@@ ag and g@@ ag pol@@ arity with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ b@@ r lies in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in treating anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study occurred a four @-@ logical failure by week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously untreated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 5@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations occurred : &quot;
&quot; on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ e@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 15@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ b@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amalg@@ am associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remain generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses previously untreated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar barrier failed ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a prescribed therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adult after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear chemotherapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis observed the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of untreated metastatic disease is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ sperger &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with as@@ parti@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ born &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous feeding influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume and an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amalg@@ am , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amalg@@ am remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of arom@@ a@@ therapy capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , am@@ ylo@@ avi@@ r is not ex@@ changeable from the capsules ; hence , ag@@ ro@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be minimal on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schemes lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those found in healthy subjects after a dose of 1,@@ 200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day , without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas used in male animals occurred in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse M@@ utation Test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ lation test of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ ar was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during administration nor after treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mi@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ stri@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ parti@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in ,
aging should be set to 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when amalg@@ am avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended close supervision , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ sc@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) more than 7 days of test subjects , the fluor@@ inated cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a re @-@ production study of gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate the necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ b@@ r lies in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the course of treatment optimisation in patients treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amalg@@ am remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be minimal on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas used in male animals occurred in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to the human after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured , such as am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ sc@@ ase solution for inclusion have not been demonstrated neither in patients treated with PI or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ig@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ ar as capsule , which is why as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for as@@ parti@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily high dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ parti@@ san solution for intake and low dos@@ ed p@@ c@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although there is no need for dose adjustment for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ MA@@ RT is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl rubber content , A@@ MA@@ RT is contra@@ indicated in case of small children and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ parti@@ asis , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@
aging should be set in duration when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer ongoing anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous kut@@ an hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; con@@ gest@@ ing simultaneously can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the potential risk for humans is not to be applied to the contained propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether amalg@@ am viol@@ ates in humans into breast milk . &quot;

the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ par@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in treating anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a prescribed 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ born &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .

&quot; - If one of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ sc@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect of ag@@ gl@@ ase .
the use of ag@@ ro@@ ost@@ asis will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you suffer from any of the above mentioned diseases or take any of the above mentioned drugs .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you are taking A@@ Gen@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have read the instructions on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are no sufficient information to recommend the use of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to gain effect in children between 4 and 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ sc@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; &quot; before you start taking ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot;

it is recommended that HIV positive women should not satisfy their children under any circumstances in order to avoid the transmission of HIV .
no studies on the influence of as@@ gener@@ ase on the ability of driving or the ability to operate machinery were carried out .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after am@@ ic@@ ase , otherwise the effects of as@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; dose of A@@ sc@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily , together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; if your doctor decides that the intake of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar twice daily ) . &quot;

&quot; head@@ ache , fatigue , diarr@@ hea , disease feeling , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence skin rash ( redness , bli@@ ster or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious nature and you can force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat intake on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast enlargement and fat sl@@ ur@@ ry in the neck ( &quot; &quot; breast@@ feeding &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , Ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial gum @-@ flav@@ our@@ ing , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that they remain in the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies of 9@@ 23 patients with wart in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo had either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is continued until all visible F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are not completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
apply the i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rin@@ se into the clean@@ sed skin area infected with cow@@ ards until the cream is fully absorbed .
&quot; in these patients , weighing takes place between the benefit of treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies in which no daily pre@@ h@@ ort@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ score leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream at higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream directly after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous use methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral region , no clinical experience has been present . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data is available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered for super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside of the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after setting the therapy with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acne l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be treated with care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after several topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most often shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the reported adverse events reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme of a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III are shown below .
the most common adverse effects probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , it frequently occurred to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ or@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe formation of scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete cure of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in an im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the recru@@ its were completely healed ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times per week , over 6 weeks , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications for exterior cow@@ ards , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively ) . &quot;
a minimum systemic acceptance of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hours half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or superficial cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months for the paint application showed no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors performed in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to launch Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is toler@@ ating this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years of age has not been identified , and for these patients no dosage intake can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage intake can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , where re@@ vit@@ alization equipment is immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
to treat 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ cles ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ absorbed by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 will ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were reported mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in 45 patients aged 5 years or older , are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditioned involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions were observed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly severe form of treatment and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the commen@@ cement of the treatment with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . in the age of 5 years it was usually within one month to form a serum version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom there has never been Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ties a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate stimulation of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ mes were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond to patients treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy parameters ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with a severe form and 4 with the average progression ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine per week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were found according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe progression @-@ form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean progression @-@ form indicated a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe progression @-@ form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage intake with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a one @-@ time dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not to be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if th@@ inning was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in a plastic bottle ( type I glass ) with stop@@ pers ( sili@@ cones @-@ chlor@@ ob@@ but@@ yl rubber ) and sealing ( aluminium ) with tear cap ( polypropylene ) .
&quot; 10 Pre@@ par@@ ation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , determine the number of th@@ inner pi@@ erc@@ ing bottles . &quot;
&quot; within the given time , the holder of the authorisation for the transfer of funds has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
this register will record safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ ine ) , is missing either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
the concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous applications ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries out this , gradually increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; however , in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditioned involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe responses occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea , abdominal pain • skin rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not to be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if th@@ inning was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient first the number of th@@ inner pi@@ erc@@ ing bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin &apos;s administration . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or if certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dismissed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously received no chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the treatment of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta resulted in longer survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the establishment of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. &quot;
&quot; each pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with over@@ s of advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the anticipated treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients with age 65 years or more compared to the age of 65 in the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data storage in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ital immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ ality rate , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ amed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( C@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is intended , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space prior to the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment - G@@ inn to get advice regarding the lock service . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can lead to reduced pancre@@ atic ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected for an application during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy except if necessary , and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock @-@ service lashing . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed infant cannot be excluded .

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ky @-@ dependent metabolic processes , which are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets , by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ oth syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ co@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ lin@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simply @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in comparison with the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and an impair@@ ment of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC was medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( int@@ ents to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival occurred in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

&quot; in addition , the patients required the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed after administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is largely un@@ altered in urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged within 24 hours after application . &quot;
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

&quot; it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , making about a quarter of the fats added with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .

&quot; the weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) is indicated for weight reduction ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used by children and young people under 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , the dosage is not necessary for elderly people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;

&quot; since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic medicine may need to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international Nor@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a one @-@ time dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side @-@ effects detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events are voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and over@@ weight subjects over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects resulting from the li@@ pas@@ c@@ ant properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of studies ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
mean change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients administered to the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which represented approximately 42 % of the total plastic concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on precau@@ tionary hist@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular danger to humans . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the commen@@ cement of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize mal@@ nutrition related symptoms : • Beg@@ in already several days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a durable dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to a maximum per day . &quot;
take note of the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is appropriate for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories required for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related symptoms . • You should try to increase step @-@ by @-@ step and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily on a daily basis , for example through 3 km walking , 30 @-@ 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic agent ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is insufficient information about the effects of this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies involving 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong respectively moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission approved Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the launch of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on prog@@ nosis , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required with con@@ current administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ T interval or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics investigated against tumours ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ abor@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady permissible concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , C@@ ins@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in an al@@ oh@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 mc@@ g. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron who were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial reduction of the plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 measured . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily IV mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was equivalent to 0,@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher after the one @-@ time dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections , the total body size was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increase , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the shareholder duration . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this permit for the transfer of funds must inform the European Commission of the plans for placing the drug approved in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of the medication provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue exhibits damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood have been elevated . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was applied to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood was reported ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was re@@ tar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; in addition , al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not affect this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the surface area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of alt@@ ar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on pe@@ dic@@ ed skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 And at the same time an oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on pe@@ dic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( Sal@@ ine ) should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin mode is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction on a specific binding site of the 50 sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site of the Bosnian protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may seem question@@ able , a consultation by experts should be aimed at . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to respond to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on stri@@ pped skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP Hem@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days were indications of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ core tests for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which achieved up to 5 times higher exposure compared to the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin ) : &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were found in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed sen@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation ( Version 6.2 ) , is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the authorisation for marketing authorisation under@@ takes to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; for irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes from gaz@@ ing on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambient light is applied within the framework of an existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can end up from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the &quot; &quot; Twin@@ rix adult &quot; &quot; vaccine that has been approved since 1996 and the FDA @-@ approved vaccine for Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan from three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last inj@@ ections .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix made a month after the last inj@@ ections to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ability ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active ingredients , any of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ination plan for the basic imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated or combined with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies observed after a pri@@ ming vaccine ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination may need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immune memory in cases of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should be immediately available for the rare case of an ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level under certain conditions , so that additional vacc@@ inations may be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected in an exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous form , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and hem@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it should be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants between the ages of 12 and including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and ir@@ regul@@ arity on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received ambition had over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and wear@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schema .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old V@@ acc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported serious adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , at month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses obtained in a clinical comparative study from 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies proved to be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ el@@ ence to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .

&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the normally scheduled treatment of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / her child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated recently / or if you have received / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ Very common ( more than 1 case per 10 p@@ uted cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • loss of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 de@@ pressed cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Recommen@@ ded • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ printed doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended ras@@ hes that can be it@@ chy or infl@@ ate , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like symptoms including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain conv@@ ul@@ sions , di@@ zz@@ iness , gri@@ zz@@ iness , loss of sensation or mobility of some parts , severe head@@ ache and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels causes discomfort or disease feeling , loss of appetite , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , and abdominal pain , lymp@@ h node swelling increased tendency to bleeding or to bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by rub@@ b@@ ish of the blood plat@@ el@@ et . &quot;
23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has shown that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; for more than a month , ammon@@ ia can also be used in the pre@@ history of patients at the age of over a month with complementary enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) . &quot;
&quot; - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ pod fluid ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; it can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was &quot; &quot; approved &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because only limited information on this drug was available due to the disease &apos;s r@@ arity at the time of admission . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first life @-@ month ) , there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is formed . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually with respect to protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium chlori@@ de : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as associated clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and eye formation . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium chlori@@ de via the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ c@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain two nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for every gram taken in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen secre@@ tion ( sodium chlori@@ de , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium chlori@@ de ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born infants at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im Trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated with sodium chlori@@ de and a protein @-@ reduced diet , were 98 % survival rates . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium chlori@@ de in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous dosing of sodium chlori@@ de ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycl@@ us@@ oids or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies could not be phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting .
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeated with sodium chlori@@ de ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no clear effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t take any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ pod or nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium chlori@@ de : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium chlori@@ de , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat tur@@ tles have been exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) before birth , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ c@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain two nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess oxygen &quot;
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , it can be assumed that sodium chlori@@ de is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are not reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ules form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring sco@@ op 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on@@ ful 8.@@ 6 g of sodium chlori@@ de . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium chlori@@ de is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium chlori@@ de may influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , de@@ activation of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you are experiencing one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , ob@@ struction , loss of skin , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the box and the container after &quot; U@@ sing the date of use . &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium chlori@@ de may influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single doses or@@ ally or over a stomach fi@@ red@@ th ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is guided through the nose to the stomach ) .
&quot; • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring spoon of gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable spru@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients applying a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( a different antibody ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients frequently used a St@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year is as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ om@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the launch of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if one PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; prior to the procedure , a bolt release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intake of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second release of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the dosage intake is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is properly administered . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used for patients with moderate ren@@ al function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , it is possible to admini@@ ster a second intake of 0,3 mg / kg and re @-@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake of the bolt . &quot;
&quot; patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included , was the ACT value 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in patients suffering from arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points , in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) , bleeding can occur throughout the treatment . &quot;
patients who take War@@ far@@ in and be treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should consider monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved before the treatment .
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ it@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental investigations are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more frequent in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .

&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , Re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ locations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more frequent in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organic classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on base region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether th@@ ru@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or on the cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because th@@ ru@@ mb@@ in is on the one hand the binding of bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly spl@@ its up , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din had no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ted thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if one PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not process effectively .
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter time of action than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can produce no insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type 2 diabetes , where insulin can not be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin shots . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in or any of the other constitu@@ ents or patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorization to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the launch of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal muscles . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin consumption can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active force , the brand ( creator ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the date of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment scheme .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ di@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ ll@@ in , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of symp@@ a@@ thetic medicine such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ lis@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ s occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not appear in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use . &quot;
&quot; the adverse drug @-@ verteb@@ rates known from clinical trials are listed , grouped according to system organic classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ ts@@ - , head@@ ache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection site within the injection unit , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or by intraven@@ ous glucose administration by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ s occurs faster and the duration of work is shorter than in normal normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a low @-@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ enden effect , just like Human@@ insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was evident that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ ations a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control occurs in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; insulin inj@@ ected 2 minutes prior to the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the meal starts , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as for human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ lis@@ in in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal , compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ lis@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
