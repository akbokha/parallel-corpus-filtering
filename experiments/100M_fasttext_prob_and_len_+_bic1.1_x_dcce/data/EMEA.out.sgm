<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal sentiment."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are also degraded as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects signal transmission between brain cells by" "neurotransmitters", "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole seems to be primarily a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that arithmetic is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripistrozol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, which prevents recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were suffering from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with half-operated patients, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to avoid reoccurring, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness with the use of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in reducing symptoms than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the reoccurrence of manic episodes with previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal malfunctions, tremor (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, loss of saliva (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and mild to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disruption as well as for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiqzole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the launch of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and related manic episodes on the treatment with Aripistrozol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from combination therapy, the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripistrozole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher suicide risk associated with Aripistrozol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripistrozol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports on dyskinesia arising during treatment with Aripistrozol.</seg>
<seg id="39">Symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripistrozol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiqzole had an increased risk of sterberizing compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripibol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to deteriorating glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comborbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripistrozol on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiqzl is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study of healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripistrozol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor ') metabolism can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiql compared to CYP2D6 extensive metastases.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the joint offering of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose of dosage prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripistrozol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripistrozol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethsyorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethmorphine)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripistrozol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for people and because of the concerns arising in the animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripistrozol has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and about whose occurrence is also reported in the treatment with Aripiql, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicseizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripistrozol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"admittedly, there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripistrozol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose is of benefit because Aripistrozol has a high plasma mass binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripistrozol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripistrozol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity for dopamine D, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT2a, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiql showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder Aripistrozole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripistrozl showed a placebo-superior effectiveness in week 3 and a retaining effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, in week 12 Aripistrozol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripistrozole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>

<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies of safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or exposures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects comprised a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) in female rats at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>

<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c factor, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin in a decrease in HbA1c was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin accounted for a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main factors were the alterations of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who alone took Desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence, sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the treatment of the medication provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug effective component, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference medicinal products" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination, the liver tissue exhibits damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood have been elevated."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast, in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; in addition, alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (cracking or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the surface area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the launch of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salve, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment carefully wipes and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of reapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on pediced skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 And at the same time an oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on pediced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required when topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin (Saline) should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>

<seg id="2698">"reapamulin mode is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction on a specific binding site of the 50 subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of the Bosnian protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding at this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"if due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some infection forms may seem questionable, a consultation by experts should be aimed at."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were found in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of failure to respond to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study of healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salve was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on stripped skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salve twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2709">"the in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"ambient light is applied within the framework of an existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"therefore, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can end up from two doses."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and generates antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the" "Twinrix adult" "vaccine that has been approved since 1996 and the FDA-approved vaccine for Twinrix children since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of an existing vaccination plan from three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month interval between the two injections."</seg>

<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturability (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to the active ingredients, any of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the vaccination plan for the basic immunization with Ambirix consists of two doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines can be vaccinated or combined with a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed after a priming vaccine (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not fully assured that immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A- vaccination may need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immune memory in cases of no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction should be immediately available for the rare case of an aphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody level under certain conditions, so that additional vaccinations may be required in these cases."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal vaccination success, these injections should be avoided."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter time of action than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body can produce no insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"type 2 diabetes, where insulin can not be processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin shots."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other constituents or patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted authorization to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the launch of Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal muscles."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin consumption can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active force, the brand (creator), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The date of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase propensity to hypoglycemia are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-conditing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopyllin, fluoroxetyllin, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effects of sympathetic medicine such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine can be alleviated or missing the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-luliss occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not appear in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"the adverse drug-vertebrates known from clinical trials are listed, grouped according to system organic classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy Wird is foamed to continuously change the injection site within the injection unit, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a correspondingly trained person or by intravenous glucose administration by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal musculature and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-luliss occurs faster and the duration of work is shorter than in normal normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosescing effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a low-proportional increase in the glucosesenkenden effect, just like Humaninsulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosescing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that in an application of insulin-lulisations a comparable postprandical glycemic control occurs in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin injected 2 minutes prior to the meal, a better postpranic control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the meal starts, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as for human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves in front of the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
