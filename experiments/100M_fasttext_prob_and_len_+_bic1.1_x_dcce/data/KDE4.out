&quot; to translate the website you will find in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . from the list , select the source and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated as part of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can directly insert texts to be translated . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
further information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions .... Open the map and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the box ; add@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the view filters ( also called folder filters ) can be accessed in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Ad@@ visor filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in showing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command you can view . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rec@@ tangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tangle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display ( whereby it is possible to use the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rec@@ tangle ) . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . &quot;
&quot; how to divide the area of an entry to the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is necessary for the lab@@ eling and to avoid space losses through frames in such a way that rectang@@ les are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive sections . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent place , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a screen@@ play to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each row in the gallery .
&quot; in the file name of the image , indicate whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
display the file size of the image to indicate whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box specify whether the size of the images will be displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save In HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotation panel to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original images in the box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the comment file in the comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box own color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be set here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ - albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic imaging tools . you can use them to view , comment and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; Programs is &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program the Help menu provides an entry Problems or wishes ... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links your web browser opens a page in the fault reporting system . all the information you need is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be powerful this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start editing ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data file will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will also use as an old library . settings Edit digi@@ ti@@ fs set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; see each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ dly recur@@ sively searches the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in a hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Menu Help . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ - albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , di@@ visible software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easily its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ k ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change to full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere works : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ dable tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture may not be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed on the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ k are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a photo directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
album Date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sort by date .
&quot; the button el@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : they set the date on which of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the section of the album . this will first attempt to compu@@ te the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file in this folder is used instead . &quot;
&quot; if you first recorded an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the album &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; support input of keywords for individual photos in the range My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fiers in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Extras All thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can change settings . select the albums page here and customize the preview images to suit your requirements . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows this help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; records and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the functions that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ . you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images .
&quot; you can open image editing with a photo by right @-@ clicking on F@@ 4 image ... or editing the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... See image editing , see how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view and change your photos . &quot;
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . the applications listed there are selected by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type . to do this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image processing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image , so that information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate it . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; Edit ; delete it , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this , you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also work parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ title of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , click the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keywords . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows the keywords , which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent calcul@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you just have to click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , records , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click on it , the filter will be cleared and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you will find a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search options , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . each of these rules can be added or deleted by operators . each option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... link . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two picture sign@@ atures , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar items : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a swing erts , the results selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the successful search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ made sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ k ; find the matching pic@@ s . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ Browse . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em can be added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ box and his window will be opened .
&quot; from the preview toolbar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right panel of the window and drop it there . if you select preview images from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the images , you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly extract from a picture series . if you navigate combination mode from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the left pane . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal release actions also work directly from the light@@ box , e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Pre@@ view preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom slider under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are previ@@ ewing in the Pre@@ view mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the picture has been taken , scanned or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , protect , protect and re @-@ use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam ; we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , review , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory administration takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . you must decide if you want to save other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant import of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata in the creation page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to enable it . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written in the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the respective point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? for that , &amp; digi@@ kam , you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos while working . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often name with other programs or continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords then &amp; digi@@ k ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree on another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the under@@ trees .
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata overl@@ aps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to let you see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I &apos;ll tell you that this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author title : linked to the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is an im@@ print to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for private individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future there will be such a module for batch processing .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we &apos;re not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues must be dealt with and you can &apos;t take longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but they write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; slow down with a good record device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the data again to verify you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : dis@@ mis@@ sive study &quot;
&quot; shortly : disks keep the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT failure , can not detect this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors indicate the im@@ minent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not matter much , this is different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable result of losing time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage prot@@ ectors which also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut@@ down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with current disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they are expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies , the offer includes a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day will open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet errors on a lower level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % at work station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process with a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you &apos;re hitting your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash is struck you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ planes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security using s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ als , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , Use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the time of time you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ bid you as the current system is backwards . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression of the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source , res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the rice if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no more software that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can recommend Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files .
D@@ NG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the crude format . X@@ MP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when connecting between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of uses and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; you can use external programs for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only then export them to web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ pe@@ . in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . with some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and thumb@@ nails of all photos are displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the metadata indicates the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the photos are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one using the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and download the selected one . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folders , displayed . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folders . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must first select it and delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ k ; -@@ Album downloaded before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this about the camera system as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names , if you load photos from different recording series to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the picture has been made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are done before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data on the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % % % % % H % H : % M in the editing field . switch the date &amp; time option to add the option Date &amp; Time . for more custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced Button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically load subtitles in the target album . all images with the same date will be uploaded to the same sub@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; Edit ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ gra@@ ze an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photograph . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that lexi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographic mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ if@@ Tool from Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ marked coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any european roads . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to select from the Edit menu ; set up settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded thumb@@ nail or start image editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ pad ; specify if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should be the professional description of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; this must not be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ; without going to get lost .
&quot; save cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests in the main window above a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to specify , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the light table by &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , whenever you open the light table , these settings can be switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; using the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works without loss . &quot;
&quot; when you select loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss@@ less settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default sampling is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights as a continuous white . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data obtained from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which many cameras have and which a matrix color pixel is available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) produced the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates but color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . image ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a gra@@ dient correction , as it is carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information about how to translate color information from one color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module to start with raw files .
&quot; color profile folders Save here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , then examine this folder during startup . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be restored from one device . this is very useful before printing a picture , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon profile expansion makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then downloaded by &amp; Edit ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and additionally you will find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the screen mode . below you are the serial port , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able to mount your camera .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; try out , whether &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ qui@@ ver you can set the conversation by &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly defined by &amp; Edit ; applied if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button modifications . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; Edit ; disable when starting . this speeds up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ k under certain conditions .
&quot; searching for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; searching the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time from &amp; Edit ; if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ k , to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , please refer to this tutorial for more information . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and edit your photos and start editing and editing . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the thumb@@ nail of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entries Display / Edit .
&quot; the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ k , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules see section editing . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top of the page , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before storing or saving the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you should make a copy of your image , before you change it . you can save it with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using File Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore the button Rec@@ over image editing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image editing can be und@@ one or restored , and the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Back or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Res@@ cue from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the Back or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you get to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can edit it in the Settings dialog by &amp; Edit ; edit the main window . see the section for setting image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image from the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sets . entire image templates can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the menu item Export Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Edit ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again in the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , use either the user or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the rating below shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword words used before ; -@@ session . &quot;
&quot; the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword , so you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords . &quot;
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding verti@@ ces in the tree . all keywords in an image are stored in the keyword &apos;s IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album - data , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters from the right side are used , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have chosen several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and have created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can choose a Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare s@@ RGB &apos;s 2 @-@ dimensional representation with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ sh my monitor if I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ vibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is running the circuit . if you work as s@@ RGB in the color space , then you must either c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you try further manual editing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic merge and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction attempt to automatically make out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous strength values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; the same number of pixels produces the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same amount of pixels produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maximizes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light bor@@ der@@ tones and finishes the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; enlarge Con@@ tr@@ ast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range , and a re@@ ji@@ b@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ anonym@@ .@@ You start it using the menu entry colours white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the upper right hand side , a hist@@ ogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that display most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadows adjust the shadow details of your photos or even dim them down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons make exactly that . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings can result in a different photo than your original . if you save these , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of ink profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tone mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to always use your settings so that you can always use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or your scanner always uses the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the color effects are four color effects , a solar simulation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ter filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar power , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then the development of the image was completed . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar simulation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it em@@ belli@@ shed many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse color film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ ps the thickness of the ne@@ on light . for large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders for the application described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and observe how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most suitable . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
&quot; three controllers : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ats can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is seen in the foreground . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . this will use the Gim@@ p level format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example for adjusting entry values to the red , green and blue channel of a photograph . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a part of the curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the associated image pixels . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo you can see a red marker . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel is found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of Image Processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me because the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the h@@ iss . color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color space first . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can then be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . &quot;

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ ate . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ k ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry Picture texture applying the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the Relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; Edit ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired type of frame for your image . the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce covers it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , sh@@ kant@@ et it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ k ; tool templates apply you can place a template on a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plate App@@ ly in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ database , simply send an email in English to &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder to the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be remembered for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder updates the template of the templates automatically . &quot;
below the thumb@@ nail you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image underneath the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without a focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a col@@ on . this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more tracking than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool suit . this can be viewed using the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Follow @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; however , you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the Filter is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase of radius or amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will produce . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted anti @-@ aging filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focusing often results in better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colours in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; bite &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the sharp@@ ness of the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , fu@@ zzy masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could cause blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , blur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set this here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is required afterwards . please note that the detail retention should always be subordin@@ ated to the directional dependen@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; direction Dep@@ enden@@ cies Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD noise , a high value will produce wa@@ vy patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; angular step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the increase in quality you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the term . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Load buttons make exactly that . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it may take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ k ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance variations . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot remove the entire noise or noise @-@ sharp can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ut tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ k@@ ed@@ . however , it also eng@@ ages the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied using standard settings .
&quot; the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . use tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry , and experiment with smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is performed with a different tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons make exactly that . any adjustment of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photograph that was scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Hot@@ pixel tool allows hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &apos; light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the Wizard will notice the last dark image and this will automatically be loaded in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ision : an average of the neighbour pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gn@@ ette correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially in medium and large photo formats , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area uni@@ form@@ ly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which can be used to hold the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using the large exposure range of current filters and the color or grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers . the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction tool applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three further strai@@ gh@@ tening of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with a vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ sting of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting gra@@ ding applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool for correc@@ ting the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient &apos;s fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion second . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the in@@ verse sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in a correction of the first degree .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the sound and kis@@ sing correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or res@@ izing changes . best result in this correction as the first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ like correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the preview around the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the tri@@ mming tool in the Transformation menu from the Image Processing or through the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available at this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infr@@ a @-@ red film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Inclu@@ ge movie gra@@ ding if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gra@@ ding and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; because the filter mixes colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the pointed lights .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gra@@ ding is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
&quot; the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted and protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; two kno@@ bs exist to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for larger images . smooth@@ ed the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ k ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon escal@@ ator . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving marks your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening blur@@ r : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
cont@@ actor sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by means of random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
&quot; you can select with &amp; digi@@ k ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will be free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it by mirr@@ oring or turning to the right orientation . &quot;
bli@@ sters are definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
&quot; if a picture has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; retained aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . magni@@ fying each photo can be saved as a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; blowing your photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to crop a photo you simply need to create a rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo might look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ tangle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and width of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
&quot; in the dialog below , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to the wid@@ est possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the mapping tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed frame dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the integration help make it possible to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to share a rec@@ tangle with similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . &quot;
the golden center provides smo@@ other aid lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line which can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden rectang@@ les discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center @-@ points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographer . try to place your focus on one of the editing points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al and Ver@@ tical options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
&quot; with the Color button you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can manually repair this with the &amp; digi@@ k ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you moved it over an important point of the image , you can set it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the Trans@@ forming C@@ utting feature of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image slightly after rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle Left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle Left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture is a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ aling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; you can rotate your image horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have completed the she@@ ar , the image is slightly blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two lay@@ ups generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ading , the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; only shows files in formats that you know . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list it is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the file can be changed in image editing .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read all helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ k . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is contained in &amp; digi@@ k ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editor program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to launch the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you went back previously .

many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description will follow here .
&quot; all editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ ers , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
the upper section shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and over@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the Pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ m C@@ ursor box is added under the Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a row sign if another color follows . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that contain &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are outdated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph is in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph re @-@ calcul@@ ates and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading big graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . needs are in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window will look like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed and Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum size of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer , or eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . once again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that are on one side will be fit to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one page distributed on several pages without header and with another font
&quot; the refresh page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of the graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at every start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up additional options : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi@@ trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z tools to display . it needs the following packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can find other options in the Settings menu .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net , in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the symbol should be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch . &quot;
&quot; restore the last step back . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de .
&quot; does not change the icon , but sets the current drawing color on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for icons , background and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the Tem@@ plates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display lin@@ e@@ als and insert Uni@@ coloured : or a chess board as a transparent display . you can also set the size : the car@@ os to small , medium and great as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams .
&quot; when you open the images to the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default duc@@ tus standard to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
&quot; after you have pressed the scan button , wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the image file will appear . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image . &quot;
you can create screen shots after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all separate program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog will then appear . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera zone must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera zone here .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage . if the deviation is lower , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one location for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching dates . if you know that in reality a location lies between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog takes the coordinates from one call to the next , you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ View this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side will allow you to quickly select a large number of albums .
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery where each image will also be displayed . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show &quot;
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have read permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; thumb@@ nails allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press closure to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list by the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please look i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages .
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . you can also change sorting images or contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start generating the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go fast or enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages above the button settings on the right bottom . &quot;
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information on your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use the Cancel button . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . however , this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . more images can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images with a file selection dialog with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; by removing the images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . &quot;
do not mind to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails sent to you . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ fers will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you would like to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation use very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so not the order of the images will be used in the album . &quot;
&quot; the time interval between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds corresponds to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose from . at random each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these images , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , now in any group , therefore in people , places and in group keywords are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the pictures are displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your area of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the names , select the button which is located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to choose which image to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; when you search for the search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more . &quot;
&quot; when you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo if you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time start or choose the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this bar here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the time line displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of that period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is available as a module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the File menu .
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ Ex@@ ample pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is visible on the overview page . read more about the export files in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this will allow you to select a folder or a supported protocol for all future images , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information , persons on the pictures , shooting location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not make this work yet . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ file file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that this file can be shared so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it scans the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for exporting images is described , which you can access via the Export File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the Manual option , copy the images in the same folder as .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automati@@ cally copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ in from the web browser or from the File Import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
&quot; the im@@ porting assistant consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then to which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Per@@ sons of the file to be imported , while this category is called individuals . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : when you see images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the browsing and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual are talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can access a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the different settings options are explained .
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in this section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialog options , you can set up whole member groups , i.e. all members of one group at one time in one group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; view the settings you want to set up the member groups . with the drop down list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
&quot; the modules can be called via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . also if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order after albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview currently . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also give a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set up in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category Per@@ sons , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so do so , if you have selected people to view and pass this on to the module . &quot;
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see above a menu and toolbar . under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view any picture with notes . to do this , information about the persons shown on the image , etc. can be placed either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all these notes may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by specifying people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to move the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be displayed , you can , through that the used names are moved up , the persons find and assign them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphab@@ etically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and click on these images . in this case , simply click on the pictures before and back buttons that are located at the top of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , you can see a browser window displaying the US as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will appear . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it to sort it to a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and the appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to view this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and either select the Del@@ ete key or select from the Edit Sel@@ ection menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images can also be used without saving you on the hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere to allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
&quot; pictures in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function needs you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now in order to avoid inser@@ ting the respective CD . so , if you want to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to make you want to make other in@@ accessible and click Current View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also use all the pictures that your little sister is allowed to see , control and lock the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can retrieve the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to for@@ bid the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered on the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with your mouse and then disc@@ ard it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available right @-@ clicking on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with posit@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the minus key you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equality key sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that enter and zoom in with the plus and minus key .
the rotation functions from the context menu can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ate notes to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the Cancel and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images designed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have placed features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply fill in all the images you want to copy to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the preview pane , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
you can see a picture painted on it . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error message . then you can adjust the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Properties view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ menu item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a field of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility Level is smaller or equal to the stage chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , pull the tap water to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the tap water to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views one by one , drag the tap water in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the tap water to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bar bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere . &quot;
you can save the current window view with view window arrangement ... save it . a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon . icon Ren@@ ders in the toolbar , or select the menu entry View scene render . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to see a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally images with this quality look better .
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling depends on the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeatedly split up and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion allows you to set the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit any object .
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete set of commands by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with Copy and Pa@@ ste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the square for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type distingu@@ ishing marks .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a closer wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern with two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross ground , a floor is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold values can be adjusted . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window pane you will explain how to create and save window arrangements .
the Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
&quot; the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button , and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with the flash@@ card you get a map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points to change the destination point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when applying the button App@@ ly or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( Inclu@@ ding Final Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment you select something simple . &quot;
&quot; the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the properties pane ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment is now . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can preview the Pig@@ ment only a matte black material because you have to re @-@ enter the pig@@ ments settings at any time . now , remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any colour on the box and ball in the preview , just click on the button and then press the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select one color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball would float above the floor because you moved the bottom around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now yields a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the bul@@ let a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose first object and change the name , for example , in ball pig@@ ments . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then choose coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effects and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers . hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog impact . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo .
&quot; save the current window arrangement and open a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set the tool bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; Ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
pictures can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , downloads &amp; ou@@ ter@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ou@@ ter@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window mode is larger than the image the background will be filled with the selected color .
&quot; you can also set up &amp; ou@@ ter@@ show , so that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards Sh@@ ort@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the picture in original size . this is useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ casing ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ casing ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to this , at least issues and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to leave your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ casing ; if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ casing ; if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ casing ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ casing ; however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ casing ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ casing ; . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings , clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be in contrast to the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ casing ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same page bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer does than scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer acts as images to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scann@@ ers &apos; support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel and cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview fits in the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as seen below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the name of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before any scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , then you must select them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without having a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image will receive a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts allow you to set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting short@@ cuts ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . by doing this you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from the collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
accompanying require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events when there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; when a script is started , Amar@@ ok implements the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is picked up . the script could now &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information on the new piece queries ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ate , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the option of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should correct your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining module should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Skri@@ ll . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of getting through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . also , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok &apos;s intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications has some options that can be enabled or de@@ activated to compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; store the mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically by moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible while changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / un@@ rolled in order to keep the current play in the visible window . &quot;
switching to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting Custom fonts , the otherwise gray shown section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context Browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; selecting Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated below for foreground and background color . &quot;
continue playing at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
&quot; set up the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is cli@@ cked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow field shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD color for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if you don &apos;t use your own colors , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can set the O@@ SD to appear on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment . &quot;
the cardboard card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate even more settings in this map card .
the cardboard card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the tick box next to its name . &quot;
Browse recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is still necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the flash@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call up similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD pres@@ ume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by following in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the time , this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the Met@@ a info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes while editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , de@@ activate it . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if this is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / repetition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar can easily be forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . then please check if Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
most of the installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come into there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column to view . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the addition button , the button playlist is stored . click it . &quot;
&quot; you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config utility . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is What media types supports g@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default do not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in the search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to use another sink ( e.g. on the sink ) . &quot;
&quot; Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . g@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning ; see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ X co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia all around the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register register register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with tag @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the play start . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the soft tones of the music you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows are separated . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size of the window .
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console there are many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio @-@ CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , you instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , and F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; this basically adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a unit exactly as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and edit : select review or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Edit metadata dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want you to know when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not related to the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon when playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and get the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click Create New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of error reports . &quot;
presumably added &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; probably use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . &quot;
I consider the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 even though the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok &apos;s second sound card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported any further . you may of course want to take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can become the new ( urgently needed tut@@ or for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection will make you search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ ting Audio @-@ CD from the menu bar . a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format opens . drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have various options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages will be listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a text display showing the current piece or current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the runtime view . you can switch by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the field with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , buttons PL and E@@ Q are also available . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting up equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the tune position slider . use the slider to adjust the tune position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own default settings . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the E@@ quali@@ zer tick , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ lists of all for &amp; k@@ des ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later . they provide information about the current piece on different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover @-@ picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; the images can be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context Browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information in the music sub@@ window should be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t run any text script , you can choose which script you want to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - At first , the pieces are sorted according to the performer . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphab@@ etically sorted among each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the toolbar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down box , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows , from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This le@@ ashes the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
&quot; app@@ end to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect . &quot;
tune pieces into queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
&quot; to transfer the pieces to the media player , add the pieces to the media player . see the Media Player browser for more details . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This is the reason why the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open dialogue for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; marking - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
set up marker - Chan@@ ges a record marked as a compilation back into a normal album . the album is then displayed no longer under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok , it must be mounted in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . so the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and trigger the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar contains a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than space is in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping down . in this case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert decay files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters there is a text field in which you can enter a filter . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; when you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . if you type one , for example , you will find all entries that contain one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) are found in this example . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to search for entries containing spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something looks for pieces that don &apos;t contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either included Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right click on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button with which you can add the playlist to the right . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore any changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , increased analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . this menu allows you to set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , de@@ activate the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want to play , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on them and select Upload . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; both pre @-@ set modes random@@ ly mix and playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can directly start playback . the recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be de@@ activated again . &quot;
&quot; the New button re@@ fill the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can modify the corresponding settings . &quot;
right clicking a dynamic playlist gives you the ability to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while playing plays . &quot;
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a new entry will appear in the list . after you have installed the script a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please see the section writing scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding , you will receive a lower quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to do with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog which looks similar or something similar : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original file has been read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get module . to fix this problem you start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the libraries search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback from the forums and learn news on community help . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also has &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has all functions , which also has &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files and subsequently burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an help program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file Save for each single project file .
&quot; if a project is altered and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between stores and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you would have called for each project file closing . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project which is not saved , you will be asked what to do , as if you had called file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you run this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by the What is this ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows even without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD which you can then burn later . also , you can also create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a DVD image previously created . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even ways to change size and trim black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of the tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and blocking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ect@@ view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the ke@@ yp@@ ad assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is equipped as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are function@@ ally identical , so your taste and style of your task is crucial , which of the contribut@@ or programs you submit . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then type something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) void er@@ ase C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , a D@@ CO@@ P reference is obtained for the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set volume &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ mp / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many coding that coding these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction on enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only one thing needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; if the CD@@ DB requests the CD @-@ data to the CD@@ DB tab , the CD@@ DB file will be launched . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ co@@ der , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the Setup dialog to configure the types of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different learning flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , to set the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ ilers . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the coding explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to keywords ( tag : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the translator ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can hurt . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( bog@@ us ) address as the one used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; when used by fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution when this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the read @-@ in wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the encoding of the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
the encoding package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the co@@ dec can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device identi@@ fier of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; do not control the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step Ex@@ ample . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 C@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a &amp; CD . &quot;
the device name is passed to the selection program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device identi@@ fier of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the / etc / f@@ stab file and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card General Settings . here there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; This is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory or file name is changed with Con@@ qu@@ iry &gt; Ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equally as regards the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything in the same way as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , it is possible to code more than one WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be pushed into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , check the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD was successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best suits your opinion best for your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; input field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you don &apos;t just start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help file for more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current unit .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or select the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the button selection to read the read process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the Ri@@ der to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the toolbar buttons . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a mixer that you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this means reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third job is enco@@ ded in the queue of the coding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ ders of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you know CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . the best way to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different learning flash@@ cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program start there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke system up@@ lift of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . the usual file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the pick @-@ up from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the left and right arrows to change the speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , then interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and again both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text at all : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section , how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name of the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the each of them in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog will appear , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be reset . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted , and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required transform@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , it is essential that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general usage is as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the identity sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument uses to put on the sound with the number M . if your Keyboard does not support a gun trigger ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with a patch 127 ( fire@@ wall ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Dru@@ mming @-@ Patch the patch is meant , where each sound is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 items . &quot;
you can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ benefit events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to find two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you can see which sounds are being played just .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the View Channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a MP3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , activate the automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window will switch and drag the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies but I &apos;m trying to do some time for my hob@@ bies . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and no one gets money for it . therefore , I would like to stress that I only continue to program because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high with AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid may also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you &apos;ll need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; S@@ MB ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you press an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ categories will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and durable play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only edit it if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Players directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category and select the next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist with playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without comparing to the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tru@@ sive option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / DATA@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / export / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here you can see the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er.@@ c like the setup of the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the Setup dialog file assignments from K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manual alter@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er.@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be found . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support for SM@@ Bs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by S@@ MB for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scann@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there instructions on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is the root user to run the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts up slowly but why does every time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; play .
&quot; latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) are used . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; box ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you would like to compile and / or compile , please refer to the mailing list &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &amp; box ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop . &amp; box ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use it can also use a lay@@ man ( lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good view to &amp; latex is given ; it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick entry Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also specify some settings related to the document .
&quot; document Clas@@ ses : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , Films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
coding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex and latex ; for inclusion , they only have to be selected in the tick field . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other sources editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; box , this function automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be useful for retri@@ eval . as soon as a DVI @-@ file is created , skip &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document as well as other information such as the font and is , in addition to PDF , the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; using the source search , the elements of the DVI ; file are drawn with the editor and once on one element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is found in the &amp; latex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project settings . &quot;
fast construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ und@@ â &quot; &quot; as well as &quot; &quot; over@@ grown &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection boxes should be con@@ spic@@ uous . the selection boxes have been developed for fast integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Other is available for inser@@ ting articles such as tags , joints notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection dialog possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; box ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e &quot; &quot; is used for the definition of the font file . the letters can be specified for the main text , the marks , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two options available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font file . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu or the quick construction of the button . &quot;
the source code must be stored prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; box ; exec@@ utes the storage automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , the logging should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font &#91; e 12 &#93; is created and only a few other letters should have a different font . &quot;
the changes are supervised merely inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; -@@ label language , then follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to do this , min@@ d. a quotation , a few passages in the bold and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem are to be applied to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor &apos;s View or C@@ trl e can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( English e V ICE I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed with printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex , the conversion into converted other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the search search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&quot; &amp; box ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can set up settings boxes ... &quot;
&quot; to perform the search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; box ; open and set to the corresponding line . for this you must set &amp; box ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as a text editor ... Editor )
&quot; should errors occur when using quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot open , an error can be found . if an error is present , this will be shown in summary in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
the logging file causes the source of errors in the source code . in the editor you can see the pop@@ s of La@@ Te@@ X errors and nests La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; box ; ski@@ ps to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ level users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; box ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; -@@ files created . if a simple way to create a template is searched , it should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; box ; uses &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu Tools directly from &amp; box .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can directly start reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; latex command reference , which can be inv@@ oked over the Men@@ Ã © La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with a C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a dr@@ unken Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most different types of source code and to emphasize this . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jump tok@@ ens . this is a special kind of bookmark within the text . the menu entries do jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by the jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a mark . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; box ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options have been added into &amp; box ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is added ; special commands for selection . under Edit select , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of rows , which contain an empty line on both sides ) . this expanded meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; latex , commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also exp@@ ires &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a root line ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the entire row is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the Description of Processing Select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; box ; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
with this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command is spra@@ yed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to place the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted welded groups braces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command is close to the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple reference marks are used as a symbol . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; box ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two easy reference marks . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; &quot; uses . &quot; &quot; &amp; box ; knows this case and for two complete suits for &amp; latex ; one . &quot;
this automatic insertion of double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , so that German or French characters can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is inside a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; box ; not only a line break , but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; in a table environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ closes with a close line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; box ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . you can set up these settings boxes ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ surroundings and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; box ; tries to make this possible . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; box ; after the next tab in the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code recovery offers , it has been added to &amp; box ; for special commands ( mostly for natural latex ; ) . &quot;
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and is mistakenly deleted . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , ropes can be installed , so that a jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ti@@ est jump mark possible and the desired parameters can then be folded . &quot;
&quot; settings boxes ; set up ... boxes ; exec@@ uting settings can be made to these lists . it may be different types of mail lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands , as well as wa@@ iter @-@ books of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the processing of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the call of full recovery mode will result in a large list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; box ; a special mode for the realization of the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete edit mode over the menu item Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key can be stopped . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; box ; see that this is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be merged . &quot;
under Settings box ; set up ... dump ; exec@@ utable can be made to these lists . this mode uses the drop @-@ down list of the promised mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; the lists can be set up in settings boxes ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a sample list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word is introduced to completion mode over the menu item C@@ trl + Alt Space , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot;
&quot; large email attachments are not helpful for automatic recovery . however , it has been noted that many wells can be written in one document more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete satisfaction for all already written reports . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... boxes are completely shut down . here , the threshold value for the display of completion can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the encryption files can be installed in the folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Lay@@ ing Graphics dialog arran@@ ges the creation of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the menus to compile , create conversion and create view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used to select Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Fast@@ ening command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project Project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; box ; allows for exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished yet and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a rather plain system , in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; box ; offers a lot of different aids to support users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents , including a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; latex . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k containing a database with all to &amp; boxes ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or pot@@ ters .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; box ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; box ; is also part of the Fink project , which allows &amp; box ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aiming and sacrific@@ ing for many hours for the development of tools , which we all have to use in compliance with the GNU General License . &quot;

&quot; the status of a certain holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Editor Options dialog , on the Color page . &quot;
&quot; you can disable , de@@ activate or delete a holding point using keys , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the toolbar icons . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is captured and either in the stage manager ... Dialog or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ output window . the following exceptions apply to this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the Deb@@ ug@@ ger menu , whereby the management tool is most important . &quot;
clicking on the step @-@ by @-@ step output in the menu will display a dialog for selecting the running speed .
&quot; to stop the procedure , press the W key or select step @-@ by @-@ step exec@@ uting in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to verify a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; to re@@ beat a Public@@ ID , select Public@@ ation ... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the then displayed dialog . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Stage manager ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the box guide source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; source files included by the &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking on a source entry in the shown list puts the cursor in the main window to the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Stage manager ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the box guide source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
&quot; all found templates are listed here . it is important to note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT are valid . therefore , multiple templates may be available with the same agreement and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template in the shown list moves the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map card in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g inspec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT &apos;s source code in which a global and local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , one gets a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable has a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; then , a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is transferred to the corresponding line of this file in the main window . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we still need a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the sub@@ du@@ ed working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selected folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time it is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened index@@ .@@ doc@@ book file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick with current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result is named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can use the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage and add all contained plu@@ gins . we describe each &amp; GUI element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
&quot; the user can choose from the list of team members , who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ names and setting up your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another benefit by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions performed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that inserts a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Pre@@ ferences dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such conductors will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to insert notes is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; notes may be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the assigned nick@@ name of the team member is , role a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader sub @-@ project ladder should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project names , as shown in the examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the braces and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic , and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not close optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatic update : when switched on , the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : types of mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files .
default encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will however be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates periodi@@ cally backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been inter@@ changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by stopping non @-@ asking questions .
&quot; the location of the behavior of V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ s and the source text view in the shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set into details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Struc@@ ture Tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when working , and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause ab@@ dic@@ ation is different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view where the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action triggers the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to send a Deb@@ u@@ g request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Edition view .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include in the script is corrected . &quot;
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if the current one does not exist .
opens a dialog where a variable or print@@ out can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . can help to get better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up and Script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly and IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic lists of image buttons ( above the editor window ) that could insert text and statements faster into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , A &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the properties dialog . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool bars allow a fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a sp@@ elling error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain anything else as a single element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the Tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only exist once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
&quot; specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( for example , one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
checking the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; header function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &quot;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via DT@@ D editor DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings . click New Deal to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detector settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that use the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be received by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . input can be specified in the input field , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard output , by setting the value in the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create one &apos;s own toolbar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available , so that an input can be entered when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; in view of the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually started as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool bar to set dialog via Settings Tool@@ bars . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to make a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator can support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button , the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new toolbar has to be tested by half of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has already done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree .
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = Fir@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folders are displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but look &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth being shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the wasted resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . in different places there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team is considered correct and useful for publishing . to make an article , we recommend to sign the resources for our team as well as for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private g@@ pg key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and sign@@ aling . in case of problems it warns you and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages currently not yet created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this name is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type definition : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly to these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use that user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ ons with info and the tool@@ bars . please refer to and for more detailed information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the flash@@ cards , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area to another context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , help the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , when the string under the mouse poin@@ ter refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , navigate , open them and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with card holders stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on how they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects can only be utilized in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project is also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows you to change all the available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder do@@ c to a project , project specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this guide shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this guide shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate page of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar to a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus files on your system . for that , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of her bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old , it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly converted to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , please refer to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ in Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters contained in the clip@@ board add to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Write , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch on or off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using Shift + Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script files and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and turning of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the column @-@ column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the posts Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; search the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; ab and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
&quot; loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project dir / Tool@@ bars , and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project . &quot;
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved by Settings . actions must be saved by toolbar toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
&quot; removing a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar can be found in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu of the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activated the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied , if this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available templates depends on the k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
&quot; checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D , using the external application ti@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries it can sometimes take time or create un@@ happy graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help based on the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but it is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; leaving this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; make sure that files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted . if a project is started anew , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your opinion . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the check@@ box , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the File tree in the Profile pane or changed with the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which can be re @-@ read on project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; now only G@@ ub@@ ed can be selected . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by placing a separate view of the profile for each profile .
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre@@ determined event occurs , such as backing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior can not be influenced at present . &quot;
to open another project choose Open Project ... from the Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will occur . the same happens when you download a new project . &quot;
the project structure view gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves similarly , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in the right mouse button context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . &quot;
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten during programs . this option is useful , if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it cannot be read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there are many views , i.e. , by simple exchange of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar from the Project or Project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the toolbar can be st@@ owed using the toolbar . the addition of toolbar buttons is treated below in the Ad@@ ding toolbar .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , where new action can be created , a new toolbar can be created , which can be set to the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , additionally the entries action will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code escal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more detailed documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area again and again . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click a folder on the right and select site template in the file tree or project files to create a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ define he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically create them with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files , or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a drop @-@ down box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be configured so , it would turn off templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows for pre@@ defined or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to create a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source @-@ Editor , which are accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ absence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still required . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL Editor . pressing F@@ 9 will enable the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... Accor@@ ding to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the web page , you can choose the tools document properties . the document properties dialog will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cursor is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting by means of a push @-@ button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed every other anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some toolbar functions such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , you need the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in a style or x@@ ml file loaded in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , the orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
this command checks for a partial or complete agreement with a template named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 . x@@ s@@ l : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop @-@ point must be dissolved for the UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are checked again shortly after the start of each cycle .

start a shell . then type the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
&quot; adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; added to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on &quot; &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; execute the conversion 20 times , if --@@ repeat is two times indicated , the conversion is executed 100 times &quot;
the input data files are treated as HTML files if the support for it has been activated in Lib@@ XML
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input byte if the support for it has been activated in Lib@@ XML . this is turned on as default .
&quot; on systems with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can use the arrow keys to scroll down / down through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands . &quot;
&quot; multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; as an argument , a stop point is set in a file named &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template consisting only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 bis 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
&quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; merging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the reg@@ ression at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; merge with the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check co@@ effici@@ ents frequently , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more anger when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are located in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der
&quot; open dialog lets you manually typing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and show them next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; by selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving . &quot;
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start merging / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison then starts immediately . in the open dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just drop text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into a different program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare single cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is represented on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict that must be manually resolved . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , no more line is left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . carefully go with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insertion button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture in@@ ward / C@@ trl @-@ picture Ab@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the wag@@ ering return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered sc@@ aled . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically sets an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator key is pressed . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press Enter or Return , the previous row will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . even when merging white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return type &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
changing this option does not apply to the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change will be active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the encoding fields for coding , a brief note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only work with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ machine commands . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore the numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ look column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just skip the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . merging the current file together in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . ( if this function is used to start merging again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , you first pass it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal command command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for the line sequence . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command for line spac@@ ers to convert the input to upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; CVS and other version control systems use some keywords for automatically generated text strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern $ keyword is required , which removes the automatically generated text : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another word processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so practically er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l only needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the time line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders in recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without really performing them .
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the File dialog .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; when you read the folder , you will receive a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C don &apos;t have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date appears , error message appears , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge operation , one file will be processed after the other . it status column indicates if the merge succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the Setup dialog the File Com@@ par@@ ation Method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ user will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target , the B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options Run , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes , and you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select to start / resume file merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter a bug , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later date . even if the merge action was ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ ursor spot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not lead to any recur@@ sions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare the chan@@ ges@@ et date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to trusted the chan@@ ges@@ et . no real comparison occurs . the files are considered identical , if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the chan@@ ges@@ et . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because the knowledge is assumed that the other file was not modified too . ) This option should be checked in any case . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; usually , the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you may prefer to merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change of change . therefore , the permissions or the change of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust the Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . first , K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s Com@@ modi@@ ty ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by getting into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format , which could store this information . &quot;
you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ user on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the root folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists from them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tions ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current cursor .
&quot; only show differences : files identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
only entries are displayed that show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging . ( behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed again when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ set@@ ters in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini show of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it &apos;s quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , end them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ise , On Desktop and End . the commands do the following : &quot;
maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; box ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as seen from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation at the side of the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . additionally it runs outside the control panel .
right @-@ click inside of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up the sel@@ ector switch ... allows dialog settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded with new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying pane . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can view &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying pane ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the location of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the cursor in the magni@@ fying pane and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition to the Shift key , press the Shift key or the M@@ MB , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner will be moved .
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document once again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Com@@ peti@@ tors &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use an area of the screen , so as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artists to web designers or visual disabilities . &quot;
a more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / K@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the Ad@@ dress bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ s@@ f.@@ net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ de@@ .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the cursor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and pain for each mouse click . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that each mouse clicks pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , suffering from pain related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you break the movement short .
&quot; the intelligent move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after it em@@ ulated the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before letting the mouse button run . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; when switched on , the shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before it releases the mouse button again , when no moving mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can reduce the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will be &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the state after the last pressing . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart moving should first be switched off . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can then add the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click ab@@ ides without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using intelligent sliding in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent sliding is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to select text to copy it to the clip@@ board and insert any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets mu@@ te users speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history to speak again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the installation catalogue . &quot;
&quot; in the text passages , you can often select text passages without having to type them in . text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are added to the wor@@ m@@ line . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; set correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site word extension and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the box of the card card language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the field of selection below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using kt@@ ts@@ d as language service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
with the first selection field action based on the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the text passages or in the bar for text passages .
&quot; when selecting So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be directly spoken and added to the output memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will be entered only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text message book is not saved . if you ask for saving , it will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be stored . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; word &quot; &quot; page contains a list of dictionary entries . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; for this source select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ d ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the script . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries will be merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the processor . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the processor . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation cache . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar can be displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably do not have the command for voice output correctly or not fully typ@@ ed . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card language edition . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ lay system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for voice output setting , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the voice output command line , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ v@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as standard input .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the voice generator setting is only performed in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can print text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken phrases that the user can spend time and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer included . a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows every application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; caps ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the voice output is done via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs like e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of voice output from the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; b@@ ail@@ out program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ de voice @-@ over@@ s ; , an application without visible windows , which offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partly .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ access . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you need to install program speech patch and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the cardboard card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card map General will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card@@ holder spokes@@ man in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops system .
&quot; choose a type of tuning here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls range to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the cardboard card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; see order to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &quot; &quot; Language &quot; &quot; system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the &quot; &quot; General tab &quot; &quot; tab to open this map . here , you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , proceed &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start , stop , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the generic and tick language @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read , and select Text from the main menu . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read displayed text . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text you want to read , and select Text from the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ notification is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you of events that you have established . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . &quot;
&quot; a good example is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters text is edited before it is sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any job you send from the cardboard card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not possess any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such file reads , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be even further types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; provided with pre@@ defined string substitute filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules don &apos;t apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page . the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following entries will be displayed below .
&quot; you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . case @-@ sensitive is not considered when compared . &quot;
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like ; it must only be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; enter a language here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key when you click the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ run programs you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if you agree . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you can find in the package . &quot;
&quot; XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be used on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card speaker , or a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; pass a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by means of the speaker properties that the program specifies the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker type selection filter can over@@ ride the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be chosen that best meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;

none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converter filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string substitute filter . &quot;

&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand to use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; converter filter , but is not necessarily required . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and comp@@ ress , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to &amp; kt@@ ts source code from the source code archive or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first whether speech dispens@@ er works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . for this purpose , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed in such a way that the device of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly enabled and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ member@@ ed into individual pro@@ positions . the user can go back to pro@@ positions or paragra@@ phs , refrain from repe@@ ating or termin@@ ating the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application contains text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Map Spo@@ kes@@ person to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the flash@@ card reader device is shown . as an example , the set up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices known , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these sliding controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some kno@@ bs and display this gray , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly ( with greater memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , when starting a kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window appears kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not yet running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited sentence . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can go forward or back on the job that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are performed and managed . editions of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled or deleted without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ ml ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ml ; % corresponds to double normal speech speed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose the standard .
&quot; on this map you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that appeals to messages . if you have just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome anyone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the editions of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the card card notification will appear . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are selected by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the conversation , when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot;
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
here you can enter the properties of the speaker you want . standard select the speaker that appears in the list on the cardboard card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) .
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the al@@ erts to a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes stamps for controlling voices , voice speed , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and type detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; kt@@ ts , because only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional border recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ line detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add another line detection filter , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch off the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker selection has changed . to do so , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start with the first set , not the whole text block , which can last for a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal level detection filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
statement Rec@@ ogni@@ tion filters compare text with a regular expression of the rules and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits . note that the standard set limit recognition filter will retain the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal note recognition filter from acci@@ dentally , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card reader selection , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . &quot;
&quot; use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card card speaker ) . in other words , no speech properties are defined . &quot;
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker . if you cannot delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is closest to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the language set in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker area , which is most likely to er@@ ase the following , click the Def@@ ault Spe@@ aker button and then use the Spe@@ aker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back @-@ up . &quot;
g@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and crashed . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved this is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time . if I hold a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA to prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / dic@@ tion@@ al@@ int . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be search@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive themselves offer a setting for speed on the card holder device . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set the voice speed up . &quot;
&quot; I do not create that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own drawing box filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the Kart@@ ei@@ reiter orders are displayed , the order consists only of one set . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for g@@ Stre@@ amer by calling before using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflict with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of this , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes in addition if you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is read before . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the voice speed but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for voice synthes@@ izer are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option for the switch off displays the configure parameter which causes the passing of the creation .
&quot; when default is set &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = Target . for example &quot;

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . for help , please refer to the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the M@@ MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this voice from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . for more information , please visit . &quot;
&quot; in this process additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the M@@ MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA festival . it is required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; you can find instructions in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

&quot; epo@@ s is a free , lively speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak langu@@ age@@ . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this voice synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the cardboard card speaker , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS voice synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the Card Spo@@ kes@@ person . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ oping speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine installed on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can neither pitch , volume or voice speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured in a functional way , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device generally indicates and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing &amp; running Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index option . when starting the module network settings , this option attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release status . selecting non @-@ recurring questions can be set up permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider &apos;s network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... set up in the Di@@ alogue Device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be performed without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switching on a disabled network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an activated network device is de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name with the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will dis@@ connect this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the name resolution computer &apos;s name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added or removed or changed . DNS records can be ordered by selecting an entry and ascending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons on or down in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog . &quot;
the list by name known calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during boot if there is no DNS server available . in small closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; usually the list includes some known computers , some of which are &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will support . this still in the test version of IP is intended to replace version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , click the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Modi@@ fy calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings module are not immediately visible in the system . to activate the changes , the following command needs to be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
installing the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical user interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool for their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networking technology is given , and in the second section , all configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to focus on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ space , the network administrator is the contact person to use a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a dedicated area specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , there are usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 26 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it is not surprised if there is a different content in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is handled by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another level as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ® system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and accessible . &quot;
&quot; for a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and displayed in the description . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here set the otherwise existing environment variables out of force for all tasks listed above . in a de@@ activated variable it is disabled as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . then go to the Edit New menu . alternatively , right click on the Tas@@ kbar and select C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be started . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , click Select .... &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a tape backup program based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which moreover provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you backup ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; cle@@ ars the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre@@ tension on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding the entry . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; dat ; is indicated by a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not conform to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not conform to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , whereas DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , proceed &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; as soon as the backup is initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog will show the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Ex@@ am@@ ination ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box appears for review . in this dialog you can check again your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files that should be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select restore ...
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog box will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of tape :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located on the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
&quot; the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files had not yet been fully implemented , at the time the documentation was created . &quot;
you can set the settings in the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted and k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , it tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the tape will be dis@@ car@@ ded automatically . do not use this option for floppy spre@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ sensitive block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you must tell the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file consists as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the tape has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar releases should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system uses the various log files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system uses the various log files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear to you , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or according to the entered strings . the list of the log rows is now automatically changed so that only log rows are displayed , which will fit the selected filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the process name in the log file system log , and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar , and then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level indicator . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can for example be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log @-@ in lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log to display in the menu . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is fast becoming the standard for the control of the program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . and , for this reason , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the boot of the system or when switching to a different running level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for the program in different places and starts the first one finds it .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can modify / etc / init@@ tab manually , then you can repair it by re@@ opening the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts then start ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; run a server runtime , which only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user runtime ( eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start ( or stop it ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by using it elsewhere . this will only happen if you draw an entry from the field of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new section . to simply copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to a different running level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ time ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are extracted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ way , and now the machine is constantly re@@ opening . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in stand@@ alone mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the standard runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg , Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) can be easily terminated if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two learning flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards may appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the file card password management will appear if shadow passwords , such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , such as in BSD uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
this card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space restriction .
&quot; the group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
