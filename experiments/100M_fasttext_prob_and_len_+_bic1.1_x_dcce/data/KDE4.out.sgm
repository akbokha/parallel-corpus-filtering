<seg id="5">"package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making these easier available."</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in & konqueror, select settings extensions.... Open the map and select the desired modules."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the box; addons. please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>

<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists in showing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command you can view."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display (whereby it is possible to use the relative position of the caption in the rectangle)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemaps for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to divide the area of an entry to the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is necessary for the labeling and to avoid space losses through frames in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive sections."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent place, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="59">"like all & kde; Programs is & digikam; an open source project. that means, it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities."</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program the Help menu provides an entry Problems or wishes... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links your web browser opens a page in the fault reporting system. all the information you need is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">"& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam; and hopefully soon answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, you should be powerful this language."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in to the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start editing; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you have to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data file will be saved. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want to add. & digikam, you will also use as an old library. settings Edit digitifs set up collections"</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as a base folder. & digikam; see each subfolder as an album. no image is changed."</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; thirdly recursively searches the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in a hidden folder. this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList will not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up and edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Menu Help."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digi- albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitised."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"digitised; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, divisible software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digikam; is how easily its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digik;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change to fullscreen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images everywhere works: you can put an image in another part of the Albendable tree, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture may not be stored in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the filename only works if it is displayed on the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digik are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also add a photo directly to an album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete new collections after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">Album Date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the button eldest, average, new testers: they set the date on which of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the section of the album. this will first attempt to compute the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file in this folder is used instead."</seg>
<seg id="92">"if you first recorded an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the album & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; support input of keywords for individual photos in the range My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifiers in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="98">"information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is this, you can change settings. select the albums page here and customize the preview images to suit your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows this help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digitised; records and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can view all the functions that have been edited with & digi. you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images.</seg>

<seg id="190">"the most common protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the crude format. XMP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when connecting between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything there."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of uses and business models.

<seg id="378">"if the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before you try further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, synchronize, automatic merge and contrast expand from the menu Correct Automatic correction attempt to automatically make out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminous strength values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same number of pixels produces the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same amount of pixels produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light bordertones and finishes the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"enlarge Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range, and a rejibation of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochanonym.You start it using the menu entry colours white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the upper right hand side, a histogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that display most pixels very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadows adjust the shadow details of your photos or even dim them down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly that. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings can result in a different photo than your original. if you save these, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of ink profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tone mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to always use your settings so that you can always use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or your scanner always uses the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the color effects are four color effects, a solar simulation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canter filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar power, also called Sabatier, was an effect of when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then the development of the image was completed. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar simulation effect. the original image is the (1) and the processed intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse color film made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without a focus, as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a colon. this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more tracking than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool suit. this can be viewed using the Correcting Follow-up menu."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the softener with the menu entry and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase of radius or amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will produce."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). fuzzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted anti-aging filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocusing often results in better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colours in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"bite 'sharpness: this is the sharpness of the Gauß' sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is' sch '. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the sharpness or the Gauss. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, fuzzy masks produce better results than sharpening. this could cause blurred masking a larger neighbourhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is required afterwards. please note that the detail retention should always be subordinated to the directional dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction Dependencies Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD noise, a high value will produce wavy patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">"repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long run time. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the increase in quality you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the term. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the Save as and Load buttons make exactly that. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file, and later recharged."</seg>

<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot remove the entire noise or noise-sharp can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>

<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it."</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially in medium and large photo formats, can often illuminate the entire sensor area uniformly. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which can be used to hold the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharper effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using the large exposure range of current filters and the color or grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners. the vignetting correction tool applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the vignette correction filter and with three further straightening of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with a vignette correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient's fourth grade corrects the removed corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the strength of distortion second. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the inverse sign of the parameter General."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and results in a correction of the first degree.</seg>

<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to share a rectangle with similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother aid lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line which can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spirals."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden rectangles discussed above. their vertices are the center-points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographer. try to place your focus on one of the editing points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the Color button you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information on your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. however, this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and purpose. in the following, each area is described more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-Example pages you can see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is visible on the overview page. read more about the export files in."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why this is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no more images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting area, set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best select a base folder for all your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this will allow you to select a folder or a supported protocol for all future images, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages are created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information, persons on the pictures, shooting location, etc., then you need to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not make this work yet."</seg>
<seg id="932">"with & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images into a .kfile file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported."</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that this file can be shared so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can either export a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it scans the images that are located in the .kim file. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export File menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"in the Manual option, copy the images in the same folder as .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select Export File option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size because the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kin from the web browser or from the File Import... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">"the importing assistant consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then to which folder the importing images should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category Persons of the file to be imported, while this category is called individuals. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse and view images: when you see images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>
<seg id="947">"in this manual you will go through the different steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, over (2) the browsing and prestige, up to (3) advanced subjects and customization options."</seg>

<seg id="959">"since the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures."</seg>
<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications do their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. also if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order after albums so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"simulating & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture preview currently."</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also give a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">"if & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module."</seg>

<seg id="971">"see three lists with a text field by specifying people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the following idea is to move the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be displayed, you can, through that the used names are moved up, the persons find and assign them faster."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally images with this quality look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling depends on the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is repeatedly split up and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion allows you to set the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn jittering, change & Povray; rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray, which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1522">"--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and auto-ostereoilers. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the coding explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example to add the & CD; add titles to keywords (tag: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (note of the translator) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can hurt. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumblebee through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; when used by freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides an up-to-date list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution when this is not done yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read-in wav files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoding of the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the codec can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about Kodiers can be found in the chapter Welter Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the device identifier of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; do not control the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step Example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset Extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 Cases."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. however, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg; by trying to copy something in the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section covers the basic set up of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably only done once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a & CD."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"aside from this example, please note: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection boxes and freedb is not used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, this is more than 620 MB, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card map."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required transformations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, it is essential that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define keymap "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. the general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the identity sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument uses to put on the sound with the number M. if your Keyboard does not support a gun trigger (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with a patch 127 (firewall), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drumming-Patch the patch is meant, where each sound is another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc;) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 items."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be defined with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-benefit events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to find two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you can see which sounds are being played just.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a MP3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"previously, activate the automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), only in the & konqueror; window will switch and drag the desired file into the window by & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off the automatic add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mi. First you just want to play the first file. so, set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.mi. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">"these people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"& kmid; was written by & AntonioLarrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga (Spain). at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies but I'm trying to do some time for my hobbies."</seg>

<seg id="1713">"after changing XML files, you need to select the playlist with playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category."</seg>

<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer;. here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of SMB. here you can see the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer.c like the setup of the backend per mimetype. here is an example like a flash with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">"Flash" can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">"so that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the Setup dialog file assignments from KDE."</seg>
<seg id="1725">"the Conqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check)."</seg>
<seg id="1726">"thus always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by manual altering the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer.c. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:"</seg>

<seg id="1728">"to configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be found. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it."</seg>
<seg id="1729">"since the VDR support for SMBs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)."</seg>
<seg id="1730">"internally, various names are used by SMB for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, source, pipesource, tvscanner, tvscannsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository whether someone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html tag 1 = tag1.html tag 2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag 3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Introduction,... Introduction = Firtion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntaxes..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folders are displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"spaces influence nothing, but look & & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the docrc file, which is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are certain that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the wasted resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. in different places there is an E-mail menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team is considered correct and useful for publishing. to make an article, we recommend to sign the resources for our team as well as for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for your private gpg key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading tool bars, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signaling. in case of problems it warns you and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages currently not yet created by & quantaplus. it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2080">"fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly to these concepts, without their understanding and quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the regression at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no clues on the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; merge with the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check coefficients frequently, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more anger when somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are located in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by using only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2295">"by selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A and C however a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merge is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison then starts immediately. in the open dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; just drop text into a comparison window will be supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into a different program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>

<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare single cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is represented on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changed] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insertion button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture inward / Ctrl-picture Abward) or to the next / previous conflict conflict."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"sometimes, consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. merging the current file together in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files.

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, you first pass it to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal command command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only for the line sequence. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting diff results. however, an external program is required and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for line spacers to convert the input to uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">"CVS and other version control systems use some keywords for automatically generated text strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $keyword is required, which removes the automatically generated text: SED's /\\ $\ $\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"the ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another word processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so practically erased."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl only needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needed, perl only needs (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line-like algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the time line preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>

<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the boot of the system or when switching to a different running level. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program in different places and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can modify / etc / inittab manually, then you can repair it by reopening the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts then start? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; run a server runtime, which only lets httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user runtime (eg; & kdm;, network & etc;)."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another device is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start (or stop it) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by using it elsewhere. this will only happen if you draw an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new section. to simply copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to a different running level, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runtime (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are extracted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runway, and now the machine is constantly reopening. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in standalone mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg, Apache and httpd) can be easily terminated if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two learning flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards may appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the file card password management will appear if shadow passwords, such as / etc / master.passwd, such as in BSD unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more."</seg>
