&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain how to say so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ica and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he gained at the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever achieved . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which records people from around the world , a deeply believing person , with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s view of the world was not consistent with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her lifetime , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues helped me get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Du@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp cleared his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as rac@@ ist .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respect@@ ful , indicating an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick that comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . : so much like &quot; revol@@ ting the wh@@ ites against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as fri@@ ght trauma ) as the great Van Jones cited , exactly what America has done so magni@@ fic@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
would someone not like you have a place in your America ?
he received a unanim@@ ous and lou@@ dly &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s country now , &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love to music be destroyed by rub@@ b@@ ish

&quot; what is the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Municip@@ ality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ gic city C@@ ate@@ ura ? &quot;
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close link with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists - but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth such a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ mo@@ il you learn day for day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ designed instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double @-@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown somewhat , which he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year the world generates about 1 billion tons of waste .
&quot; those who live with him and who live with him are the poor@@ est - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of garbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can tackle illegal fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia , before the other coast of Africa was seeking . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to tail one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this is why illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trac@@ e@@ ability at the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very atten@@ tively , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , so suspi@@ cious travel routes can be discovered , such as those that suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then , based on this information , refuse to accept such ships at their ports . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attract commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license documents , indication of fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You dar@@ ed not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close the ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels . &quot;
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fish@@ ers use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what where - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to conf@@ is@@ cate without a license and had hardly expected consequences , now know that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after being helped by F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets whose use was forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight illegal fishing , exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of producing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the expul@@ sion of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on ten@@ ure , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by assembling on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( example : the return order of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the office of current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but finally the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of government decision in her latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates belong to the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum has been the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( such as the round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join forces to support the National Assembly on 27 October . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil war and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter pictures , which tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves spread the news about police repression in the city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators pulled back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not bear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national dign@@ it@@ aries did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making a round which depic@@ ts the extent of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innum@@ erable people on the streets . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are counter@@ fei@@ ted .
here is your expul@@ sion !
on the road !
&quot; others regard these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from its point of view , has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis and is rather concerned with silent voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or going shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was issued on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano was now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ Administrator . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Service 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my dad started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t forget that they don &apos;t have to kidn@@ ap you one day , and I will have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become sal@@ ute . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me in the car at the entrance .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I saw in it , and saw a couch that men were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were fixing the end of a cable . the other end was fixed to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people sat quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said : &quot; what do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you get me from there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to the survivors , the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , said to the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , it became clear to me that war criminals are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... steal , then this is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could contribute to this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a criminal and I replied : and you who steal cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you by yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
this is how my Father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that at that time on which I wore a jacket and a roller co@@ aters made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; the disappearance of the body is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &quot;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I had repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself , why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally reno@@ unc@@ ed my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the urine in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Su@@ re@@ ties were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were indem@@ ni@@ ties . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ enge : murder ; torture and rape by officials .
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ informed translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word was written on a shield , which means &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps also with evil h@@ ind @-@ thoughts and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has often been shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the conservative daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &apos;s daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Protocol ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents nationwide , is definitely a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of article published on Yahoo , the notably un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the web site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills , to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate English into French - not French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , nevertheless make translations within the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies particularly to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless , but of large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider websites are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ Fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests specific domains can be er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ s who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke with pride of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; what has become of something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned is that children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witnesses , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ mean is generally still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , their daughter in the belief that they can finish their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n has lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra continued with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; some days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the crime of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there won &apos;t be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate children &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; her brothers had to work all the time , and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that her still had time to learn . &quot;
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food too . &quot; &quot; I needed more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read an editorial from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought it intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while speaking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak again to her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made it possible , they explained . &quot;
&quot; she was fully aware , however , that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are har@@ ass@@ ment and har@@ ass@@ ment that are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ s when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I did not have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrative director of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday when possible .
&quot; the ad was given five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the town of Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then , the summary of the summary was once again switched on : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ mean tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we succeeded in aboli@@ shing systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani have been ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) , and the system of Mens@@ Ãº ( where the workers as Hal@@ b slaves were treated ) , read En@@ com@@ ien@@ se ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published by Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to grant citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID card numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . unclear is how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password by the telec@@ om ministry &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; conduc@@ tive research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the parliament , in whose interests the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , where a life imprisonment for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; in protest . &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ am through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out of sheer delight . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North @-@ East Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a major pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring islands Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture still had a nuclear accident , just because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Special Report shows which progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spar@@ es were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ated of accommodation establishments ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was to be res@@ ett@@ led to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this case . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees who had been evacu@@ ated after the disaster in accommodation establishments were res@@ ett@@ led to final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident attracted large @-@ scale farms in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , where only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land could be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the nuclear trap zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population , it is harder to find their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to find an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ated ones . &quot;
in its introduction the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents found that still not enough in disasters prevention was done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones , which are still in accommodation establishments , are older than 50 years old . it is known that they have to compete in proper homes because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the World is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has consolidated its affection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer broke his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . across the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him on Saturday and now moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face is identified , attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officers were beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ c@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters briefly rush to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

police ass@@ aults
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which there were brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen were sitting at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have tu@@ cked street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo focused specifically on a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the rest , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still ground .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands at 4 : 00 in the morning every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern over the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective tot@@ aled 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of existence , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was an official document , which differ@@ ed only with respect to the parts that would be removed , addressing the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; &quot; he assures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the stopp@@ age of the factory in which he was building .
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ ch was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work places and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to medit@@ ate , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other factories . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they have become spare parts .
&quot; without prospects of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .

first Nations te@@ ens use hip hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do so by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshops guide mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop concludes that young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely ignored .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences caused by globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is at your disposal , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever care for me
but I try to continue my days on earth
&quot; this is the day when you will hear our cry , &quot;
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will lift ourselves up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and as our youth go forward &quot;
so they can do what the Creator has appointed for .
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic dishes ( not a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is right on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) is exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend today turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic rib@@ bed decorated mobile tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some sho@@ wer@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in eating food is becoming more and more complex .
&quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an ascending flight into the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anybody who would say &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other bizarre plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # ... &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which dedic@@ ates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually are made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of national and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind every body , behind every bone find in hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co ( German : &quot; &quot; learning to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who entered the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( deutsch : &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who ab@@ lon@@ gs secret graves every weekend after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to seek out and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here also with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out , because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the hop@@ el@@ essness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified , that they were &quot; upright . &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family had been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this article , she describes how armed criminals held money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never fa@@ des away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these aw@@ ful days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega , journalist , published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a father@@ less and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years before , when he only saw a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence perpet@@ rated by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8,5 kilograms per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links , contains images on which violence is depicted . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a ru@@ mor or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this incorrect coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ting and explo@@ ding . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon became a victim . &quot;
&quot; government officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the football world championship . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ ted bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of char@@ tered bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while individuals look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was tra@@ cked several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count the cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the image from the DR Congo emerged again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and potential extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , acci@@ dentally off@@ end the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash report published by the United Nations described those who could escape pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which mistakenly claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from DR Congo to get this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to being this statement , but did not have the image taken in connection with the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of wrong data
traces of these false coupling reaches back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , and some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published on which page they were published . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been inter@@ connected ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , published now , has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later turned into circulation by the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ man@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo image emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and released a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in Paris and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which were presum@@ ed in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and has saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo had been included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ u ) also show ink , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original article of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ concep@@ tions and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and taste the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissemination of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . at times , these images even are demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures can des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study investigating how violent media act on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used to deal with the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
&quot; such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ d language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The la@@ z@@ iness or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ rau@@ d other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable , and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood disaster and natural disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls stopped on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly went back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . t@@ witter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next , we add rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head scar@@ f high , tied from an American flag , other slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already brought this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit , have to be reli@@ eved . &quot;
to be reli@@ eved
I am not alone with that .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting creates a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued ste@@ ad@@ fast . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , flaw@@ ed narrative dominates our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality , which in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the United States was not even able to choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to this by slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ tim@@ id attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ sore Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ resolved Muslims and Americans now ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , all Muslims stand with them - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost every time for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by the ongoing band from a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information that is already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger , who tear@@ ing down the head@@ scar@@ f of a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they go back to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Mos@@ ma , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I wie@@ v her in my arms and her the Arab verses ap@@ per@@ tain to the protection that seals the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim identity is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my mother@@ hood , the image of my grandmother is mat@@ ernal with her sisters , as she has been winning a competition in the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslims means to speak the prayers that they told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; being Muslims is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised for centuries by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company called the Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept over his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , his family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslims means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have been &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was thrown off a century ago above a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , cas@@ h@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent , apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy finds the US and carries the suspect a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ atory of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia in this tw@@ ood . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ates that started with President Bush and were wi@@ dened with President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just those countries , which bom@@ bard it . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous No @-@ Fly list that largely targets Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs which we reject on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we must lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to abst@@ ain from the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are coming back decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints that we have in our news @-@ editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but which today made me a must @-@ have Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may evoke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that character@@ ize our humanity may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley Con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the creation of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; have been included in the public presentation four decades ago , even science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; others &quot; to soli@@ di@@ fy ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the counting of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported a different initiative of Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk of small and not quite as small languages is not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided by creating cities , accepting diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening , often associated with it , &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening to listening , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved . &quot;
they call out laughter and emotions rather than the language no longer a barrier .

they were attentive ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico calls on the US to re@@ establish public debt &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 3 April 2017 several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place in Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of res@@ etting debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not pay off with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he did for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up , and what are the real cost to which it is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that they had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes was more likely than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he offered me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; who I carry with passion , &quot;
if your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
during the course of time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
the history of Bas@@ tia is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or under assault by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release back to previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , whose Rat Cam@@ ba@@ za met between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for its res@@ etting to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General Prosecutor of the Republic granting the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old position , as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to address the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; it represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note of is that the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the offen@@ ders .
&quot; however , the company apparently held no reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had to eat . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for its silence . &quot;
reluc@@ t@@ antly !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says that the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing morality and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , when it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long term of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in jail : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cut and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous verbal representations , when he was vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not like that . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was free .
&quot; and today the company , in which he is leaving mon@@ ies , sets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ sourc@@ e. ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users of injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the web , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; Any@@ where &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ et@@ ook .
&quot; what should it do instead , carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat has proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to download , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking questions : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which have no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to take control of the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot;
&quot; but rather than cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , looked at more in context than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Child Convention on the Rights of the Min@@ ors , the min@@ ors are defined under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to reconci@@ le laws to children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; however , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft of the bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent woman who could be deb@@ ated , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Bill against Child Wo@@ e was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one else decided against it .
&quot; once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before finally had been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which conce@@ als the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the he@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost all worth it . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abo@@ lish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the mar@@ ital network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; following Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age of marry in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the amend@@ ment to the marriage network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all MPs who were opposed have voted for the law .
the child marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing tur@@ tle .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law was to be passed , and he seems to dissolve his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ th proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only provoke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or continues to be the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use circum@@ navigation tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as has recently been described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform still remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now displayed . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed ways . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot access the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought forth both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an error page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when the respective country Wikipedia is closed . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself , if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is carried out by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a Su@@ h@@ len@@ er Nas@@ horn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this prime situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ sten@@ damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to take pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know , for he stood already face to face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I too was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ ggy appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . it took up to 12 days until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated her family and village community after having contacted a married relative with his name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far less fear to fear , if at all , they should not come after this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers as well as house@@ wives , played a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs present in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ bath@@ al campaign , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini has been working with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and leads this club . &quot;
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion rounds , acted by women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; not speaking out loud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all have to maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not with@@ hold this , is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; initially , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by the name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on . &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched their first disc@@ us @-@ lu@@ b with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get started the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she all asked , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day on which they had the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the crus@@ hing of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women may never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she cl@@ ung to herself during the whole exercise , but another decided to release the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
&quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding , and the situation was in force . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ematic red dot on the forehead , which indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc @-@ red dot , if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women did not cease completely with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things such as our identi@@ ties on our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only wore sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ als combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into the roll : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and are not members of other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ iss of more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells others about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the home of the &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les Memorial Day &quot; &quot; in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . about 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese Kara@@ oke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kite of the Beat@@ les out@@ lived everything .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les memorial day is . &quot;
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places related to the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les memorial day is . &quot;
&quot; right today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; today , I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat r@@ amen no@@ od@@ les with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
so the day is going to run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are here ! &quot;
&quot; follow the h@@ ash@@ tag , and leave it , to find out more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
single @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia war@@ med the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trading , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken out .
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot;
&quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man &apos;s gold could contain or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks against bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in South Africa conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique in Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the area of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ed rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches of wealth . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , suggest@@ ing that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed a country where people would have shame to go to street , work and other achievements , a nation in which men would not hurt or even take their lives to gain their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to gain wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police officer Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous : &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt sympathy towards his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand public access to the Internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who out@@ lived himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; his stay and the constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show the honor of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody between 2011 and 2016 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after having announced his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , other countries have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came under shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as she told in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
they are meant to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it assists him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical assistance he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing told Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u Ms. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us about :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those rights advoc@@ ated for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u on 29 June for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France would eventually take him up . &quot;
Tai@@ wan@@ ese Taiwan
&quot; the Council of continental opportunities in Taiwan challenged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lators Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling democratic progress party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual lift to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in a statement on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the topic , the good old cor@@ p@@ se emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he tar@@ nished the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ ut@@ ational methods .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference , in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ assem@@ bles the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must our prime minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t tell what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world will be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I reply . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans probably cook in anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons at us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if you would conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; basically means being sp@@ ook@@ y - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can stum@@ ble . &quot;
to be harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm hear@@ ted , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ded Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
&quot; a pop band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ unces the j@@ un@@ ta , which sei@@ zes power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civil government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tat@@ too Colour , describes a young man who tells the rules of his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video refers to the continuing military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian paragraph 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; setting up &quot; journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose there was also established a new unit in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes the people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict face against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic offensive ) . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta still pursu@@ es is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , which im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Asia Minor

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Mau@@ rit@@ anian war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ bour@@ ava are located in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ reci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians were living and working on Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and the ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are abandoned and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they pull back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply for@@ ba@@ de us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept any financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
&quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; aunt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a while , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets around $ 9 for each child .
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ ens and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; she is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; mother Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston where she will find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mother Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a blind al@@ ley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expen@@ sively .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single instructor , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers consult their phones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone away . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean@@ ing &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also used the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had replaced messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control your home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often impose extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the people random@@ ly on whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are in a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( the &quot; &quot; SP@@ AM &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which it emerges that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; freedom House &apos;s current report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ ma@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : all cri@@ es after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything has van@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to its name .
one who has beaten herself into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dissolve into smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are caught up here between the walls your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have det@@ ained me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters sought , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put any high demands on a city that is blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply ceased functioning in the district . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt courage@@ ous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined to a glorious picture that ful@@ fills my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way up to the security service office . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near .
his hat@@ eful eyes set up on me .
and you &apos;re gri@@ eving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old ; it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put it in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eal every detail exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably gave me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoner , and can put me immediately without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell gen@@ us was a &quot; &quot; first person &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ known middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized by me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ den@@ ner .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ored on the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the wheel ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yers and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al impressions and betra@@ yed the close eye @-@ cat@@ cher of their view of the world . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I attended the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; despite the expression that sli@@ ps him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to me not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat .
when and how this happened was ir@@ relevant .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to getting punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to deserve this punishment . &quot;
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t like him enough , why they exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no favor , which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to feed my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me as minutes ago . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I am answering the voice of an exhausted person : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had let me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and saw H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured out Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sc@@ rub@@ bing of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under open sky , especially when you have a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic Camp@@ a@@ ign Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the band &apos;s engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the tried and tested legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement probably shouldn &apos;t be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew traditional gender norms to Lei@@ be by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Ci@@ vi@@ ties reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a Act on Anti @-@ Crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence must &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release is often required for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects , which have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been dri@@ lled , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are political in the core , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to realize later that his comments were torn from context , distorted and in his opinion cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not consistent with Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ a , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service announced several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason that they had cri@@ tically critic@@ ised comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has led Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , street uni@@ forms and arti@@ fici@@ ally accomplished demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ vel and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the st@@ ables , the drums and dancing have been passed over more than one thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ si@@ ties , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a height of 18 meters was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in hair@@ dresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we built this educational community out of love with the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article entitled &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel expelled , to accommodate affection ? &quot;
the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation did not go out of their head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Mo@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) .
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty meant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms round the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over to him personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , which was most urgent . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former Fi@@ ghters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ant led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bodi@@ ans &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him lying on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I spoke to him anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him very tightly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was also sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to start with , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together to form a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state appeared on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never found hearing and had no suff@@ rage , and realizing that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hate , were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former warri@@ ors responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ am@@ per@@ ova and whose first published on the website OC Media took place .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reports of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that depends on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the sex equ@@ ation of their country woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the lap .
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family , you spot ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis .
&quot; apparently , some women had heard everything and began to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two cut@@ outs in my right lung . &quot;
OC Media : in which s@@ add@@ les were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for that , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humili@@ ated your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on top of the window .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without notice , without all . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you wouldn &apos;t believe , you &apos;d be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this emotional barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when chat@@ ting with the camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed the place ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : last week , I filed a report in Washington . &quot;
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who had in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he told me that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there were not so many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer then than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wearing tu@@ bular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me even one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace begin ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : which activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t delay a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ated influ@@ xes .
I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; this is the nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to show you with foam before the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ dents have what the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear this . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he was suffering from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video made on YouTube kept the moments when he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fol@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - imposed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab people to dispute their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian farming . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated disease , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k you@@ ths has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , finished primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mo@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist , resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination : &quot;
&quot; since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pros and cons to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists struck alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world awak@@ ens and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - have fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money than men despite the same education . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women , sooner or later , encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the grounds of sex is still far@@ ther across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , in both as well as outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migrant background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a black woman who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to sex and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and no longer will fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alised being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , to drive their ego@@ istic program forward . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender , as some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ anism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ laim@@ ing ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can re@@ conquer ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces where they can be fully assured and where the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin , I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my existence as a woman . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oeing - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a matter : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is based on neglected , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena displayed because of abuse , the adverti@@ sed display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also did nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman retired . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , when women inv@@ ent ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report themselves to prosecution authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 bats and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ score 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the available figures are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements went to the District Apostle &apos;s Office for domestic violence . at 70 % of them , violence against women went . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adver@@ ts for domestic violence at the peace courts . 86 % of the ads of women came here as well .
&quot; in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of psychological abuse notification . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse notification , will come to two women who do not do this , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want to do that , but then she did . this should repent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognis@@ able : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without mentioning names , she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had failed so long ago by Carlos , and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria case everything began with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # caring ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a stand@@ alone offen@@ se and punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the law text has been changed in some ways in order to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is to be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must be borne by the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply permit to display and receive a secure housing . &quot;
ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ate and contribute to the perpetr@@ ators of offen@@ se . &quot;
we must allow such a long ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted by the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law were changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a big set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continues to attack attacks a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he serves a year of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were arrested and tried again later . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after losing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he is the chief minister in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , including freedom of human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , intim@@ id@@ ate and imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict and hin@@ der peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment for three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having placed judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance case . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited by ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS recorded the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemination of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to jail sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were , among other things , condemned by the distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a security deposit of $ 5000 was arrested for Al @-@ Abr@@ i ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i appe@@ aled to the Appe@@ als Court on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the death sentence of his six months prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j still remains in prison , where he was sentenced to prison . &quot;
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to go back , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again lod@@ ged an appeal against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ vise the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in order for her journalists to pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under any circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman have imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights work and exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with permission &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research carried out on site , there are two reasons : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the supply of global health care , which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic had a serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as Post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Libyan health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier is a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a cre@@ acher herself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this contribution of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ arks , the first plant which has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
&quot; the patents not only applied for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cut leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or card types . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but now needs longer , as his work is becoming more and more difficult due to more and more constraints . &quot;
it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der to whom I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;

it is no accident that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
they have been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , to cross it to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; &quot; he says , and refers to the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which are being offered in August and September 2016 . &quot;
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to further their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is com@@ promised , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming more restricted , un@@ negli@@ gently shr@@ ink@@ age . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only complic@@ at@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or car@@ rot . &quot;
a question of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; ad@@ versaries of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much more predictable due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ aker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Agricultural Ministry , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most up @-@ to @-@ date genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety also breeds its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly gent@@ ri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , it creates most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which you think it &apos;s pretty easy for me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding are different from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not easy to apply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be the official start of the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection between Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken particular care on where and how much is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ stained in spite of this attack and the scor@@ ing of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who defend the law in order to uph@@ old the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles , which he writes for not accessible websites and media for Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government , was even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video about how police force violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of del@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempt to murder , un@@ load at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave are going the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked it from 24 May to 6 August 133 web sites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , possible by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surf possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; the situation is further wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis to help them against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a town in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day , newspapers in Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ port to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation , the force of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the paper called &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on August 16 for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explains the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize war at all .
&quot; the same video explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police who are only shooting and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning , as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , Rio de Janeiro &apos;s state is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; dedicated to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia has stressed , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for many years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly bombar@@ ded by har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is a non @-@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; stra@@ y balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the people of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
it is now a week that the police declare the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : learn Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently approximately one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , leading to the need for residents on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms as they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports global voices that have been fighting for three years to announce this project and express its relief that it is gaining more and more attention . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge to the planting of mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i anywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee rate , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new work@@ places for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy occurred where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spreading on the net and show images that allow for better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal told the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the roads were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching draft of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which permitted the construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; says Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these problems are due to the fact that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the server was unable to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website numbered more than half a million visitors . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the road from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups had broken out , which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was sitting in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t tell it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - perhaps never again . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many haz@@ ara suddenly felt protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara for@@ so@@ ok the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af recalls in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; true , it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high performance ratios . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only then be allocated to a reception centre , if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may apply for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation are dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
and so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ anded li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon get rid of these conditions .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af inserted his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind ven@@ eti@@ an luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated businesses , including cutting companies , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu features the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail , and aim to go back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af did this journey myself . now , he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot;
&quot; ne@@ tizen report : draft laws from Egypt enable social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
photo by @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter shared .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of a successful legislative decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who negl@@ ect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or punishment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which has been applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament submitted a proposal to introduce the tough@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , however , such a deed would be punished with jail and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean three years of imprisonment for convic@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police officers , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the presidential election of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management failed to put the defend@@ ants into the cour@@ t@@ room by the prison sentence according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan faces death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree on charges of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists listen to le@@ aked documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mostly been inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial draft law that would warrant the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that all un@@ law@@ fully received funds return . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , sheds light on how the prer@@ og@@ ative plans for the support of the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention its sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists ensured the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he occurred in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as an &quot; organis@@ er of the dissemination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government conduc@@ ts a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to use said services to remove content and to force it upon request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as restriction
&quot; Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , which said Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site had been closed because it became &quot; an information source working with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left out other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
