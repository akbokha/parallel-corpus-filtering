<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain how to say so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerica and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he gained at the Republican primaries, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever achieved."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which records people from around the world, a deeply believing person, with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's view of the world was not consistent with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her lifetime, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues helped me get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Duey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump cleared his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presidency a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, indicating an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick that comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(OB.: so much like" revolting the whites against all the other ethnicities "; word play from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as fright trauma) as the great Van Jones cited, exactly what America has done so magnificently."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion, and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">Would someone not like you have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loudly "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later, he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that's Trumps country now," "said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">"what is the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero Municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguagic city Cateura?"</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close link with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists - but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turmoil you learn day for day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with redesigned instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double-bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"that changed when Favio was shown somewhat, which he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year the world generates about 1 billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and who live with him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia, before the other coast of Africa was seeking."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to tail one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this is why illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceability at the FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentively, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, so suspicious travel routes can be discovered, such as those that suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then, based on this information, refuse to accept such ships at their ports."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attract commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions like sailing under false flag, counterfeit license documents, indication of fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system "," says Long. "" in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say 'You dared not run my port'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole is trying to close the ISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has followed and found fleeting ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishers use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support to FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what where - it simply makes sense, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to confiscate without a license and had hardly expected consequences, now know that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after being helped by FISH-i Somalia, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use was forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now fight illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i." "safety is the goal of producing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me in the car at the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in it, and saw a couch that men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were fixing the end of a cable. the other end was fixed to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated and tied with handcuffs."</seg>

<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"in the vicinity of the entrance, people sat quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said:" what do you look like, asshole? "</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you get me from there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man there and killed a man.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, the civilian, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process, said to the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death."</seg>

<seg id="263">"if you look on the map, you see that they took about this route and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the order from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of security forces, could contribute to this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I replied: and you who steal cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in anger, struck me and cried out:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you by yourself."</seg>

<seg id="284">This is how my Father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of that at that time on which I wore a jacket and a roller coaters made of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense was accused of being a co-conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">"the disappearance of the body is the last heinous act"</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I went even so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that can be done to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of - no idea where." you will never find anything, "my father said."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I had reproached him for all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I have not killed anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked myself, why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried out:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied only" "Well then show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I made the first advertisement.</seg>

<seg id="348">"the Japanese word was written on a shield, which means" older motorists, "falsely - perhaps also with evil hind-thoughts and # 8212; as" awful motorists. ""</seg>

<seg id="350">"elaboration of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has often been shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The conservative daily Kyoto Shimbun's daily newspaper wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable", "Holmes said."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Protocol apologized for the translation error. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of elderly motorists. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in accidents nationwide, is definitely a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 from a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"in this way, their share increased to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills, to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate English into French - not French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, nevertheless make translations within the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies particularly to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless, but of large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation."</seg>

<seg id="395">"the protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a tracceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was appalled and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests specific domains can be erroneous."</seg>

<seg id="420">"what has become of something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned is that children have to pay for countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society, and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witnesses, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the Crimean is generally still silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, their daughter in the belief that they can finish their training, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes care of the girl and justifies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>

<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira continued with a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered fatal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"some days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the crime of Criadazgo rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there won't be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="457">"her brothers had to work all the time, and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that her still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published by Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if accepted by the Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to grant citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID card numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video news and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. unclear is how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password by the telecom ministry" to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "conductive research technologist" ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" "Egyptian initiative for personal rights" "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft" stands in line with a pro-military mindset in the parliament, in whose interests the control is maximized and assured that no dissenting narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime, where a life imprisonment for those found guilty of threatening the" public order "and" protest "in protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of the leopards, which roam through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out of sheer delight."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza is passionate about another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North-East Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a major prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima Prefecture still had a nuclear accident, just because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo Special Report shows which progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spares were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuated of accommodation establishments (the" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ") was to be resettled to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful in this case. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who had been evacuated after the disaster in accommodation establishments were resettled to final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, 1074 of 1,100 schools that were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident attracted large-scale farms in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, where only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land could be used again in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the nuclear trap zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here again Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level, as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population, it is harder to find their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to find an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuated ones."</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of the respondents found that still not enough in disasters prevention was done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-caused, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated ones, which are still in accommodation establishments, are older than 50 years old. it is known that they have to compete in proper homes because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the rest, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of sugar cane industry was economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective totaled 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do so by hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshops guide mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop concludes that young participants discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences caused by globalization."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-group who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is at your disposal, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is right on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanguu (the" "Plastic Models of the Courts" ") is exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there is a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend today turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanguu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic ribbed decorated mobile tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some showerhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in eating food is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an ascending flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anybody who would say" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of national and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"there are behind every body, behind every bone find in hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco (German:" "learning to live with drug trafficking" "), telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who entered the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video with the title" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(deutsch:" "how fear lives" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who ablongs secret graves every weekend after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to seek out and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here also with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out, because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a Lesbian of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensing journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the hopelessness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified, that they were" upright. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family had been plundered with threats. "in this article, she describes how armed criminals held money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never fades away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these awful days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega, journalist, published the article" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation drawn by violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potatoes, make tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been past two years before, when he only saw a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence perpetrated by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8,5 kilograms per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this incorrect coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" wrong context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilting and exploding. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected for years and devastated. roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon became a victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"government officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of chartered bodies that are strung on the floor while individuals look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was tracked several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count the corpses," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been smashed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the image from the DR Congo emerged again, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and potential extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, such as this example, accidentally offend the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash report published by the United Nations described those who could escape punches, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of misconceptions and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and taste the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent pictures has already been debated extensively (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. at times, these images even are demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent pictures can desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study investigating how violent media act on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" Fake News. "they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used to deal with the context or completely abusive manner."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">"such words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobmesa).</seg>

<seg id="948">"a word or expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist chose" untranslatable "Steven Bird to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-clad language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="1001">"my girlfriend looks at me and says," "These things do not concern you, or?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "I ask."</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already brought this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">"people with whom I work or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar who know them - from the widespread concept of" Muslims "that built themselves in their imagination."</seg>
<seg id="1004">They deciphered me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit, have to be relieved."</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be relieved</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone with that.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">What images do you think of when you think of him?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">"when Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar."</seg>

<seg id="1018">"but in the Western idea, the religion of Rumis was extinguished, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting creates a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">"this narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forced Saudi, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin."</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flawlessly that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-timid attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">"because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the" other. ""</seg>

<seg id="1035">"in the news industry, we do more than just telling stories based on facts."</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1135">"storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0."</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), the counting of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices recently reported a different initiative of Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk of small and not quite as small languages is not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided by creating cities, accepting diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening, often associated with it, "these events are instead" listening to listening, to appreciate, to make sense. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call out laughter and emotions rather than the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story teller Rassidatou Conate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamusara is asked," How is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story tours."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017 several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place in Capitol, the capital of the capital, and ran to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of resetting debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions appropriate remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not pay off with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up, and what are the real cost to which it is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on October 3, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own fate, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel had taken part in a "strictly secret" command of the military court of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that they had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and state remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more likely than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught others to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He offered me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case, where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Rat Cambaza met between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for its resetting to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General Prosecutor of the Republic granting the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old position, as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to address the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"it represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently held no reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had to eat."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Reluctantly!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says that the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massive."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing morality and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state, when it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long term of imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the web, because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "Anywhere" (in Burmese) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalaraar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facetook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what should it do instead, carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat has proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to download, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking questions:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which have no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat a pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to heighten the violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the exhilarating hate speech on its Burmese pages."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, looked at more in context than on code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to tell the critics of the children's woe they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft of the bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent woman who could be debated, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the Senators of the country posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the Bill against Child Woe was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one else decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before finally had been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk, which conceals the core of the matter, but do you know what? the hee is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost all worth it."</seg>

<seg id="1367">"the draft on the amendment to the marriage network was adopted today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use circumnavigation tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>

<seg id="1399">"while the platform still remains locked, several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are now displayed."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot access the website www.wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a Suhlener Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly I called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river KurfÃ¼rstendamm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to take pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know, for he stood already face to face to face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"I too was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buggy appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. it took up to 12 days until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha and violated her family and village community after having contacted a married relative with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far less fear to fear, if at all, they should not come after this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers as well as housewives, played a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs present in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # Khelbathal campaign, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini has been working with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected individuals, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in their discussion rounds, acted by women who don't call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not speaking out loud the name of their husbands is a custom, which they all have to maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not withhold this, is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially, Rohini, who had never named her husband by the name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini launched their first discus-lub with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get started the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she all asked," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day on which they had the name of their husbands over their lips," said Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of a centuries-old tradition in which married women may never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she clung to herself during the whole exercise, but another decided to release the entire frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">"a husband of a participant was less understanding, and the situation was in force."</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinematic red dot on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc-red dot, if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not cease completely with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discus club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what they hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things such as our identities on our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only wore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes, morals combined with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and are not members of other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hiss of more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells others about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "news of those who experience it themselves", "and provide a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for" "Subversion" "(endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and a spokesman tells that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, allowing him to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, it defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the topic, the good old corpse emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, in the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system were really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the corresponding questions with non-reputational methods.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference, in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country," he obviously did not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disassembles the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't tell what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defence of the country, especially "etc., but this is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian paragraph 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"she is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "mother Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes, he answers with a smile." I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston where she will find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mother Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again," he answers, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensively.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single instructor, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers consult their phones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair weaving she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi have received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also used the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had replaced messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control your home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often impose extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China, "which publishes censored news in China, displayed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the people randomly on whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are in a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (the "" SPAM "") also published a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"freedom House's current report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urummais's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" Sleep or Death, "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane portrays his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything has vanished."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible, both from the inside and from the outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor to its name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has beaten herself into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts dissolve into smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even if the earth is on the axis of the Unheils. it becomes clear to you that you are caught up here between the walls your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have detained me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn" "learn my lesson", "as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like darnel.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all quarters sought, only my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time, it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put any high demands on a city that is blocked up into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calming after the power supply ceased functioning in the district."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence, shouting several times" Allahu akbar "from my house roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we joined to a glorious picture that fulfills my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow, nothing can give you back your voice after you have screamed it all the way up to the security service office."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to speak: "let me also hear how you cry" Allahu akbar "or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not near.</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes set up on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're grieving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old; it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought you've forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put it in solitary confinement and his father, with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father immediately with it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture that I had been exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the yard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I conceal every detail exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably gave me a bigger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one single prisoner, and can put me immediately without waiting for her permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the civil servant left the cell, and I went back to an old-proven communication method: to beat the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell genus was a" "first person". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well-known middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called" "the doctor." ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive facial features can be recognized by me, and there are no doctors here; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds similar to me?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2050">"from the distance, I still hear them screaming" Allahu akbar. ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening, always around this time the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the color of perdition, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the wheel (e.g.:" thunder, "allusion to the 13th Sure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"this was the secret of the secret: to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betrayers and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional impressions and betrayed the close eye-catcher of their view of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, this is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I attended the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me so."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant conversation, "despite the expression that slips him:" my boy, you are still young, you can do so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have used it to me not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to getting punished, even though I didn't do anything to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams didn't like him enough, why they exchanged the pipe by a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables intertwined to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them changed while I was still on the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no favor, which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to feed my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which came to me as minutes ago."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "aus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I am answering the voice of an exhausted person:" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and move away, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always had let me free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and saw Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so," "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he poured out NescafÃ© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gap of lukewarm coffee and the scrubbing of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under open sky, especially when you have a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic Campaign Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former press spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was" "just" "cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the band's engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the tried and tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continue to choose" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably shouldn't be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib drew traditional gender norms to Leibe by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'honorary killings' has increased in Jordan - the official outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Civities reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a Act on Anti-Crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence must" be kept in prison indefinitely, "and for their release is often required for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the family's guarantee that nothing will happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects, which have long been considered taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been drilled," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are political in the core, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored until 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, in order to realize later that his comments were torn from context, distorted and in his opinion censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was streamed only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not consistent with Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuova, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nua, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service announced several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association with the reason that they had critically criticised comments in social media to the problems associated with the corruption deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has led Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, street uniforms and artificially accomplished democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to ravel and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the stables, the drums and dancing have been passed over more than one thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissities, into the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a height of 18 meters was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for men's aesthetic services."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get a training in hairdresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we built this educational community out of love with the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article entitled" Love messages to guerrilla fighters, "published by the international online magazine" "Tea After Twelve". ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation did not go out of their head and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la MoliaciÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation).</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty meant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and carried their arms round the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over to him personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, which was most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former Fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former combatant led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambodians "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him lying on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I spoke to him anyway, and said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very tightly and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was also sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. joining the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to start with, students and some of the FARC leaders came together to form a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the state appeared on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never found hearing and had no suffrage, and realizing that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hate, were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would rule after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dreaming of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article written by our partner Aida Miramperova and whose first published on the website OC Media took place.</seg>
<seg id="2243">"homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reports of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that depends on the LGBTQ community there is not only created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that addressed the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queens and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned of the sex equation of their country woman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she ultimately moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a voluntary helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long will you honour the family, you spot?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had heard everything and began to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two cutouts in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which saddles were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"for that, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humiliated your family, but the whole republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without notice, without all."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you wouldn't believe, you'd be safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this emotional barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when chatting with the camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed the place?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"Sabrina: last week, I filed a report in Washington."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told me that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there were not so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrow's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer then than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "Civilization", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had dyed eyelashes, wearing tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never hurt me even one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying:" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace begin?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on morals on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who smiled and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still work as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize Teetreffs, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't delay a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I apperated influxes.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens who want to show you with foam before the mouth, that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rodents have what the cabardines have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear this."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 remarked the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he was suffering from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who are working in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube kept the moments when he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi Minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Folah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - imposed."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab people to dispute their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian farming."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated disease, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have led only to worsen the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youths has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, finished primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their pros and cons to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be hired, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - have frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money than men despite the same education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women, sooner or later, encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the grounds of sex is still farther across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, in both as well as outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migrant background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a black woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refers both to sex and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and no longer will fight for my belonging in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner said in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanly and marginalised being in a historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, to drive their egoistic program forward."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender, as some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than advocating a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming (e.g.: Africa-Womanismus: how we can reconquer ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces where they can be fully assured and where the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin, I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my existence as a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"in the past 7 years, Nabil Musa travelled again and again - mostly with a surfboard or in canoeing - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a matter:" if we had no more water, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is based on neglected, poorly observed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguay's women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weighteinefrault) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena displayed because of abuse, the advertised display of Ada BÃ¡ez also did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman retired."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, when women invent ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report themselves to prosecution authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 bats and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not underscore 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, flawed implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay." there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 advertisements went to the District Apostle's Office for domestic violence. at 70% of them, violence against women went."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 adverts for domestic violence at the peace courts. 86% of the ads of women came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the adverts, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." "there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of psychological abuse notification."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman, which is refunded due to physical abuse notification, will come to two women who do not do this," she stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want to do that, but then she did. this should repent for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without mentioning names, she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had failed so long ago by Carlos, and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse, at least, had a certain complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay laws: good approach, flawed implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# caring)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiunaMenos movement (# NonEineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid to a standalone offense and punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the law text has been changed in some ways in order to win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is to be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had foreseen the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must be borne by the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply permit to display and receive a secure housing."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"those who are silent in the face of these facts, complicate and contribute to the perpetrators of offense."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must allow such a long ad until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was adopted by the paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law were changed. among other things, a passage was cancelled which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"the cancellation of the words" gender, "" political force "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law, however, is considered a big setback."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with permission"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research carried out on site, there are two reasons: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the supply of global health care, which cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic had a serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Libyan health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices: what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the main focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a creacher herself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outsharks, the first plant which has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Mortons's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents not only applied for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or cut leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but now needs longer, as his work is becoming more and more difficult due to more and more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like lying in a river a boulder to whom I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "Open Source" "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red RÃ¶meralat of the sort Outshgeous in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no accident that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"open source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "open source" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "open source" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">They have been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, to cross it to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," "he says, and refers to the ever-increasing mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are being offered in August and September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to further their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is compromised, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming more restricted, unnegligently shrinkage."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only complicatedly."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrot."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"adversaries of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much more predictable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Agricultural Ministry, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant variations promote innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most up-to-date genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety also breeds its own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly gentrifying. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents, it creates most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years," he says. "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which you think it's pretty easy for me." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" "open source" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding are different from country to country, so the Ossi obligation is not easy to apply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the European Commission, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend for the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which should be the official start of the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has put together a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection between Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has taken particular care on where and how much is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abstained in spite of this attack and the scoring of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who defend the law in order to uphold the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it was never as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network due to alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles, which he writes for not accessible websites and media for Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censor apparatus of the Egyptian government, was even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider of which is also home to Ziadas blog, is on the other hand accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video about how police force violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempt to murder, unload at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I took it to the post of articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave are going the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked it from 24 May to 6 August 133 web sites. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"afte also documented the blocking of providers, possible by transferring internet censorship and private surf possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of web pages that VPNs offer."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is further worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis to help them against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robbed drugstore with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airport to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation, the force of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the paper called" "Extra" "on August 16 for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial" "This is not normal" "in which it announced to set up a new section called" "War in Rio". ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, will be published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"the same video explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police who are only shooting and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing that violence as a" war "is arguing."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning, as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, Rio de Janeiro's state is bigger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most recent available data. "</seg>

<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has been increasingly bombarded by harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a" enemy "in which a civilian is a non-sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" stray balls. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, fact is that the people of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police declare the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently approximately one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, leading to the need for residents on local or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms as they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports global voices that have been fighting for three years to announce this project and express its relief that it is gaining more and more attention."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge to the planting of mushrooms, Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this managed, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fungi anywhere in East Ghouta for free.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons" ": break of siege."</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, a similar tragedy occurred where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata, (@ a _ ataner) 15 October, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal told the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after PedrÃ³gÃ£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the roads were locked very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching draft of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which permitted the construction activity from case to case, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built," says JoÃ£o Sorval in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, spread like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are due to the fact that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the server was unable to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website numbered more than half a million visitors."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years before, a terrible civil war between the various Mujahedin groups had broken out, which had conquered the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, was sitting in the Ghazni province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," "Asharaf recalls in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows to prevent us from freezing at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"true, it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high performance ratios. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only then be allocated to a reception centre, if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may apply for months after registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation are dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbanded lifestyles helped Asharaf to soon get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf inserted his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>

<seg id="2929">"he reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi."</seg>

<seg id="2931">"global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot, which shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights"</seg>
<seg id="2932">"the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law, which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"users would have to register to use social networks within six months of a successful legislative decision on the website of the authority, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or punishment of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which has been applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of Parliament submitted a proposal to introduce the tougher sanctions for the insult of the President or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and government institutions is already punishable. under the legislative proposal, however, such a deed would be punished with jail and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be adopted, this may mean three years of imprisonment for convicts."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police officers, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the presidential election of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management failed to put the defendants into the courtroom by the prison sentence according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan faces death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree on charges of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi session block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia has mostly been interrogated by the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial draft law that would warrant the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that all unlawfully received funds return."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21, sheds light on how the prerogative plans for the support of the legislation will look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia refused to mention its sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists ensured the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he occurred in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in May, state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the provincial government as an" organiser of the dissemination of information. ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"this designation is part of a law in 2014, thanks to which the Russian Government conducts a list of online services that organize the" publication of information. "the law also allows the government to use said services to remove content and to force it upon request to suspend user data."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"these web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.ru and dozens of other services."</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias restriction</seg>
<seg id="2964">"Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to erase two English-language articles, which said Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site had been closed because it became" an information source working with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey. "</seg>
<seg id="2966">"it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, besides, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">"after this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"the government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left out other technology companies and the civilian population outside."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior."</seg>
