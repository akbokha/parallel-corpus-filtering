that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly published that the N@@ SA had heard illeg@@ ally phones by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has comp@@ eted against Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous people they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government le@@ ap@@ ed at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they had found that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly concerned his telephone bill , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel advice with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when ris@@ ings written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site like the one here at the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us that not only technology traders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to pay mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental representative , who is alert to the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that emp@@ ires and suspi@@ cious &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the international law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used by some few to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and covering for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always introduce it to me like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commands . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
&quot; presumably , because hitherto there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
&quot; it has allowed fraud , especially prone to rip off . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice . &quot;
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these attor@@ neys took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound very glo@@ omy , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I think that something has begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties involved a bill in the two chambers of Parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels .
we need executives in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of in@@ transparency through laws .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
&quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; ay , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot;
a stranger in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on the toes to the door , and my bedroom door shut . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the work of art , which he had bought from me , hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established such &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business plan of it .
&quot; thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post photos of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit . &quot;
on the Internet they can then invite other strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le firing .
&quot; indeed , they did not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still in sol@@ ace , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you will medit@@ ate on the things that you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design play such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we were striving for .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left neighbour &apos;s neighbour .
this quiet pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cellular phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who is actually Al Gor@@ es &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please tell us on Twitter that he was candidates for the office of the president ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had only introduced himself to his name , if he had told where to come from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold out very well un@@ locking mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we entr@@ ust the people the most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation advoc@@ ates com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are revealing about yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make vacation with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a demand that had previously not been met . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is doing very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million nights had a problem . &quot;
for people are tru@@ sting each other rightly .
&quot; if trust works , it can create won@@ dro@@ us things . &quot;
one of our guests had holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is here about economic trading .
&quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people place a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it is easy to compare Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that one visits , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub district , of which one has never heard yet ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and depreci@@ ation .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started . many parking lots belonging to the government , &quot;
&quot; students who were searching for a place to stay , were now offered . &quot;
&quot; were taught to people whose children moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality even existed before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it ast@@ o@@ unding , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the airport &apos;s security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that . &quot;
I decided to make a decision .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of In@@ dependence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passive .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves it somehow ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had finished breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess up . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday , that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were believed to be Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have war@@ med the anger of the people on terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly declare itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we start it ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is maintained only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is incorrect .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ hand and Olympic Games . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there will be some parking spaces available , but not stopping the terror . &quot;
regular visiting of a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alisation it has been noted that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mel@@ ess group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought them silence , and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that their anger would have made sense , it was a major goal for instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people present news that was neg@@ atively reported on Muslims , they rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood sw@@ ells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to declare itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
&quot; he was talented at the dental clinic , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he enjoyed De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had encouraged courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , work in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become one billion @-@ dollar business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ et penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces . &quot;
you can also build independently pull @-@ out structures .
&quot; they learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to react in general to laws of nature . &quot;
today we want to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ g@@ ler , it is efficient in for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots could fly away @-@ controlled flight equipment that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to fly it to fly , I have to t@@ oss it right . &quot;
&quot; the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right , if everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
&quot; as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned right by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine even if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration expl@@ ores synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , there is a reward in the development and the act of creativity . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; three billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they transformed the mass of three suns to pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
this short moment they sh@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in a timely manner .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life has emerged on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has produced a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands on us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided especially courage@@ ously -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ lim@@ ating black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to resolve some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye of my sick father .
&quot; basically , that was the fruit of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observations by observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . &quot;
a gravit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers teach in courses on theory of rel@@ ativity often a really brutal dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ ceful and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you : &quot;
the face of your child for example .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear it speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al &apos;s sound &#93; No one , who knows what to hear , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn roughly as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us briefly consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit each hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
there is the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to study the universe , as never before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes are happening in the nucleus , hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as these op@@ a@@ que are .
&quot; the waves of the gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to research the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring forth black holes , as Lig@@ o sees them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to take a completely different view of what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and the sounds of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly that , while I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my smallest ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ asse . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : first of all , I fully understood that &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things come out , wake up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am TV . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running consec@@ u@@ tively on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would like to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard to run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just walk around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that in a dream job it is not about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it &apos;s like I set up troops , as I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; to be able to carry a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume that when I declare to them the hum@@ ming , that I persu@@ ade the writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the tot@@ aling is action and activity . the tot@@ aling is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being unable to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ m@@ ary .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t like my job any more . the engine was out of .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps not , doesn &apos;t give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bo@@ asting .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ show , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the hum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; Today , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the hum@@ ming when you stop the hum@@ ming , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of my mens , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country that I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ ps and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; &quot; lets go . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solving .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titan@@ um sum , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the true hum@@ ming depends on love .
the hum@@ ming is the flow that comes from the lust of life .
the true hum@@ ming is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
&quot; real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a permanent rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not just as easy as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a man does better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter talks with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children make ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy
&quot; to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I will be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the piece why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my free time . the hum@@ ming then seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
that is my hum@@ ming now .
the Sum@@ m@@ ons of Life .
the Sum@@ m@@ ons of Love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but only one part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s sn@@ app@@ y to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the hum@@ ming . the land I created , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life becomes wider within me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; thereby , an electrode im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered under intense trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you must imagine that the brain is sw@@ inging to the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the fet@@ us stage , they are responsible for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
&quot; and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ pl@@ ung@@ ed them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ inv@@ ent these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ inv@@ ent the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Professor Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation and re @-@ pl@@ agu@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we last the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it happened in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Luigi Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable gift .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy f@@ akes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programmes that have been implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my che@@ ered friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are mur@@ der@@ ous , our future glo@@ om and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , who casts his long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin brother .
&quot; a mountain of unt@@ apped cash which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too scar@@ ed to invest it where it would be productive and income , with which it would be productive and could produce all the things humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars after a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time beat in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and boost real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not resem@@ ble the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a final loop , rein@@ forces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up , &quot;
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances that lead to the killing of the O@@ edi@@ pus .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , ended up too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; it would be an error , however , to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political participation in questions of state duty . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time this separation between politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually shifting politics and escap@@ ing them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today we can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics has mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ s the animals from which they feed , decim@@ ated , that they star@@ ve at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med the policy so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality is rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assemble politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not proceed very well .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to abo@@ lish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin peaks becomes higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts go deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a medical surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines are serving people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; indul@@ ging in long conversations with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income comes from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those belonging to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not owned by the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no bo@@ oming twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country in a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ating in which they fav@@ ored privileged persons , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy . &quot;
will we awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing this not , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is absolutely relevant ; &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am perfectly tangle . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ led , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you clearly said what you think about the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I can say that provo@@ king , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now pret@@ end to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells enormous in hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Greek Finance Minister , at the beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual den@@ ial that a massive rejection line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Euro Group , have also chosen den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has not made a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , was entitled : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for visiting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the review distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this will be a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average payout , average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for nothing , does one get right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or look at again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a risk and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the multi @-@ health system here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always creates the best results . it is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area in which some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use a lot of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again in order to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is important to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; so , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and reason , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s what the data says to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
thank you ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ - or No @-@ Question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will try it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you &apos;re doing , and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
