<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly published that the NSA had heard illegally phones by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has competed against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous people they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government leaped at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they had found that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly concerned his telephone bill,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit return, and even travel advice with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when risings written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site like the one here at the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us that not only technology traders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to pay misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental representative, who is alert to the polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that empires and suspicious] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness] for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the international law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, will be used by some few to hide and veil their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and covering for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always introduce it to me like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commands."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because hitherto there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, there is less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has allowed fraud, especially prone to rip off."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these attorneys took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very gloomy, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I think that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties involved a bill in the two chambers of Parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy who get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of intransparency through laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go for peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "ay, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get in there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on the toes to the door, and my bedroom door shut."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he had bought from me, hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business plan of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"thus we presented to investors:" we want to create a website where people post photos of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet they can then invite other strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile firing.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they did not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in solace, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you will meditate on the things that you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design play such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left neighbour's neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet ploughing of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cellular phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who is actually Al Gores's mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he was candidates for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had only introduced himself to his name, if he had told where to come from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold out very well unlocking mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we entrust the people the most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation advocates commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you are revealing about yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that had previously not been met."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is doing very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million nights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are trusting each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can create wondrous things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests had holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is just" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people place a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is easy to compare Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that one visits, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub district, of which one has never heard yet;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already started. many parking lots belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"students who were searching for a place to stay, were now offered."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children moved out. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality even existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it astounding,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport's security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagulator-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to outen."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passive.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves it somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had finished breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists... ""... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "......"... "..." "..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't mess up. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday, that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were believed to be Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have warmed the anger of the people on terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly declare itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we start it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is maintained only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-hand and Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there will be some parking spaces available, but not stopping the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation it has been noted that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremeless group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive on what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought them silence, and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that their anger would have made sense, it was a major goal for instrumentalization through extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when people present news that was negatively reported on Muslims, they rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood swells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective guilt, it is not just about having to declare itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental clinic, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">"she visited him there, and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:"</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did I become such an accomplished young man out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He enjoyed Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled my shoes off, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had encouraged courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, work in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I'm completely normal."</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">"if you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things."</seg>
<seg id="403">"they want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace."</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">"if people like an exception usually appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule."</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for hobbyists, is about to become one billion-dollar business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packet penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently pull-out structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and to react in general to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, one of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most Starrflüglers it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots could fly away-controlled flight equipment that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, one propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to fly it to fly, I have to toss it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right, if everyone is watching is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the OmniCouter with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned right by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration explores synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, there is a reward in the development and the act of creativity."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"three billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, they transformed the mass of three suns to pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they shamed brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life has emerged on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has produced a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands on us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided especially courageously -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by collimating black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer-gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to resolve some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye of my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that was the fruit of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observations by observatories such as Ligo measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers teach in courses on theory of relativity often a really brutal dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with tones, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transmute wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear it speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just about: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same panty with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrenal's sound] No one, who knows what to hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn roughly as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo opens a completely new way to study the universe, as never before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes are happening in the nucleus, hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the waves of the gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to research the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring forth black holes, as Ligo sees them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to take a completely different view of what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the sounds of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly that, while I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my smallest ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "kittens" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: first of all, I fully understood that" "Yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things come out, wake up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running consecutively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard to run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I don't just walk around on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that in a dream job it is not about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's like I set up troops, as I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"to be able to carry a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume that when I declare to them the humming, that I persuade the writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totaling is action and activity. the totaling is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive for size differently."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being unable to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summary.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the humming, the humming, the humming."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum won't be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my job any more. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps not, doesn't give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no boasting.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-show,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the humming was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," Today, stupid author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you are doing it, you're doing what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the humming when you stop the humming, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I don't want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of my mens, I can't do anything except watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax craps and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen" "lets go."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titanum sum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the flow that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true humming is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a permanent rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not just as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a man does better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teenage daughter talks with me for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even in a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children make ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I will be victorious. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The humming came back in my free time. the humming then seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summons of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summons of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of work is part of me, but only one part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snappy to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the humming. the land I created, the marathon that I run, the troops, the screens, the humming, the other, the right sums: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life becomes wider within me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" "brain stimulation". "thereby, an electrode implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under intense trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that the brain is swinging to the brain and the cranial pressure increases with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes a part of swollen brain mass has to be removed."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François made it."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells, which can transform into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the fetus stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-plunged them at the tapping point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-invent these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-invent the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Professor Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation and re-plagued exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we last the motor-motor area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hands any more."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it happened in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Luigi Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first of all, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable gift.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy fakes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programmes that have been implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my cheered friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are murderous, our future gloom and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, who casts his long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin brother.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of untapped cash which belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too scared to invest it where it would be productive and income, with which it would be productive and could produce all the things humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion dollars after a lot of money until you compare it with the $5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time beat in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and boost real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not resemble the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in a final loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that lead to the killing of the Oedipus.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, ended up too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"it would be an error, however, to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athic democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political participation in questions of state duty."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies since the time this separation between politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually shifting politics and escaping them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today we can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics has migrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustains the animals from which they feed, decimated, that they starve at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has harmed the policy so far that it harms itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality is rising, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism sells the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must reassemble politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not proceed very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin peaks becomes higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts go deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a medical surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" "matrix", "or something similar to the society in" "Star Trek", "in which machines are serving people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "indulging in long conversations with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income comes from capital and from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those belonging to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not owned by the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no booming twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos, "-- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country in a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time liberating in which they favored privileged persons, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global keynesianism."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing this not, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is absolutely relevant;"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am perfectly tangle."</seg>

<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirled, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you clearly said what you think about the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out, -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I can say that provoking, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now pretend to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells enormous in hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Greek Finance Minister, at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the continual denial that a massive rejection line passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Euro Group, have also chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- Seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has not made a mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that were going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, was entitled:" this was a colossal error. "</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for visiting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the review distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this will be a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average payout, average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something so, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for nothing, does one get right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look at again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican US senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design by Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a risk and decided not to make a Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data-sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. it is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area in which some very smart people unimaginably use a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem in its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again in order to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is important to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"so, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and reason, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" that's what the data says to us. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a J- or No-Question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you're doing, and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
