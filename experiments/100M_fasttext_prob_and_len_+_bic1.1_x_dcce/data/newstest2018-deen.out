Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today . &quot;
a Gru@@ ft@@ Chapel which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that can be recognized as such .
&quot; for cities and communities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called prim@@ eval leaf@@ lets , were incorporated into the large overview map . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey administration , this arose between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops mig@@ rated with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot;
the official leaf@@ let for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison Fru@@ its / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is the send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , the city is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fle@@ eces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots are no longer evidence of farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ ft@@ wards &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ven &quot; was created .
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the buying of the so @-@ called mad@@ man . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; there was first place for 280 patients , but later , 500 seats were added . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric services , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich meet on the grounds of the former floo@@ d@@ light .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; west lies the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was constructed in an architectural style based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War with bom@@ b@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße name was &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages , once stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn family route took place . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of F@@ ish@@ eries has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law from Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , led the group to publish the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people pass through . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped because of their skin color , they are killed or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear gri@@ ev@@ ances in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as racial off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i State At@@ tor@@ ney Office , showing that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be more common than wh@@ ites in the state . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring it to ch@@ ewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states committed immigration laws to arrest people for violations of immigration which , according to AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
fence Project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n @-@ Project is a project of success and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties in the cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ as@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &apos;s milk &quot; is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales only come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; as he is also the Chairman of the Fisch@@ bach B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the grass@@ land area for a lot of work , much has to be worked with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even though he does not conduct bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture , and are concerned about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which must not be explored until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted over leader , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and farmers .
&quot; Peter Weiss also stood firm : &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Service Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of grass@@ land f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a subsi@@ dy posted by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the fenced area should not be feasible ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ Project , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ plan area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but it took its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it was added as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller el@@ ap@@ ed A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the poor waste of your rich shores . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ emental rub@@ b@@ ish &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they were performing a high @-@ political action . &quot;
the sculpture should demonstrate the ties between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism , which brings the American flame into the world &apos;s surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ emental , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their torch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praised Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ man belonged to the UK team
&quot; the Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h got , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the UK team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the Mittel@@ stra@@ cken@@ wal@@ ker Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with the med@@ als and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , it makes something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to get on stage . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the res@@ etting of voters
the father of our country knew somewhat of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ple@@ aded him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
it has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate on the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are considered by some rather as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated sp@@ amm@@ ing spam &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or to silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but this exactly happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar impact on the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters hit his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set out this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home base . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about the way it was done .
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Scot@@ s@@ man in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer pul@@ mon@@ ary cancers by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; said He@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in the time , &quot; says the director of the site Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continually obstruc@@ ts construction work , represents a major problem for the construction company of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ outs is enormous , &quot; &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o and Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily , we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the co@@ iled tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a can@@ opy room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous late to work : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , rebel@@ li@@ ous against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Government of Jak@@ arta that maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheet roofs , which were converted into yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains an suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are dealt with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua has been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide according to the Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Will Edit Every@@ thing &quot; is written in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as each week has happened , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den @-@ cant@@ een sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up .
&quot; the migrants began selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has cost the native Papua ( the women &#93; of Papua - their market .
&quot; Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers increased their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Palestinian women , women and children gathered in a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and a bird song im@@ iti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators began tow@@ ing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make certain that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , bears only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he would judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a withdrawal when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; accused of more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with fierce un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ock repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lived near the hospital and witness how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ e for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ al airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; in Papua , the capital rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , President of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development was not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom &quot; according to a source that also took part in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Papua is unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years that one random@@ ly calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the units of fire fighting broke out against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) , and the building cooled down . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup @-@ coup at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup single was not supported by the two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two wins . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics are preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote did not even come to the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal came to put the finale at a neutral location . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the Organ@@ izer , the requirements regarding training spots etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds a survey out &quot;
&quot; a survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were deliberately or un@@ consciously banned items passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally bore forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered delayed that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have worn out know@@ ingly objects with clin@@ ici@@ ans through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally banned banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally damaged s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought through airport security , and how many had done it intentionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely wearing s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly the most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ af@@ e what liquids you are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the items seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant figure in announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are mere non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation deposit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about 12 percent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be put together - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , only 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization without larger interrup@@ tions . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are greater delays , then the non@@ committ@@ al of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from getting away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of the down@@ turn of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Administration , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline , which expi@@ red on October 1 , for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or imp@@ eding economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a German Federal Court of Appe@@ al decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ iting proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to determine the deadline for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ iting , who accused the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take fri@@ ght seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives it to us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress is pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the decision was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states compl@@ aining the EPA this week , said the group intended to uph@@ old the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gen their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer &apos;s original customer book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen , together with the v@@ og@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ lingen apart from the former parish church , there was also a splendid courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt dating back to 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps of the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval peculi@@ arity of the church .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were carved and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ bases , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm collap@@ sed and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower @-@ building still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ einer cultivate the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday 16th July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is at 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ ob@@ ooks . &quot;
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gen are particularly committed to the care of their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; as@@ par@@ ation &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government , because of a form@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter entered the circle of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity consumption is expected to be covered by some 11 400 households - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ ler gave green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured .
two other people were injured easily .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police indication , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person . &quot;
city and De@@ aler plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September Bad Lan@@ gen@@ des@@ aer and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the residents to the city center shopping .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the attention of the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , says Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; this means that the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Tag &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all trade professionals and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be developed anew or again . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and societies . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ ened , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third country @-@ wide &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and make its meaning more powerful for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the promotion under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own purchasing behaviour .
two deaths and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later recovered .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipe . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started pressur@@ ized tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the bor@@ der@@ wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp requested a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned bor@@ der@@ land wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president poll@@ ed him because he had den@@ ounced the Wall in public . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and sw@@ ung to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scriptions of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the U.S. emig@@ rated to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and that the insist@@ ence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull : &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man of middle aged in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and glan@@ ced through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates moved in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence as a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey , were as@@ yn@@ ted by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on their own for decades , citizens advoc@@ ates say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Georgia made it possible for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign in the summer of Georgia . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI agent , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cled the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , removed evidence and obs@@ cured the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - came into a room and listened to a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com who scre@@ ams the h@@ ester and supp@@ resses it , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ sting away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona responds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out of laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still cl@@ inging . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ ning dress stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads to Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning glory &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children squ@@ at their heads , record the f@@ aked blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ pers one to another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ord off and wipe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the after@@ math of a black pair that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks keeps his yard on his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot;
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ employment is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ thal is pos@@ ing as a rock wind , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that is moving through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ le@@ thal - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl und Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they dec@@ eive Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , dis@@ integrate a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ j@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous phi@@ c Hagen that surrounds the aura of a sword @-@ wei@@ ghted box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ically , who humble himself and bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a holding of the Pfei@@ f@@ concert in 2013 . five years later , there were great jubil@@ ations in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has come together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; amount : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open full day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a later @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did S@@ LC .
&quot; and then a civil engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is the wrong for me , and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester I will start my studies in the social system .
&quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing the FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really exp@@ ires .
other than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; a lot : well , here it is not about calculating stagn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in the head , each having a different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether an adol@@ escent who has been taken out of the family , must always be individually addressed . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
&quot; for that , I am not the guy . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut off another 3,000 jobs and cut down their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , which CEO John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , in a third cost reduction program , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ vo@@ y attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul in the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured in a statement by NATO .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised spr@@ ite &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide cluster killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits to raise the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA direct decision to delay the smo@@ g rule acc@@ . to K@@ lagen@@ um
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ stipul@@ ations 2015 , &quot; and said it would show the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ iting announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take time until the area belonging to the church has been part of the community , yet there is no planning permission for the project to be undertaken by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are ho@@ vering to see such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous housing , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by means of funding . &quot;
the construction is in the refurbish@@ ment area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ ades , capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to indicate the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which is le@@ aning against the environment @-@ construction - as well as pit@@ ched roof - which reduces the height and makes the building more economical - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well , but now you lean to the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m difficult with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal involvement .
it is behind a concealed subsi@@ dy of already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface you don &apos;t give a grant , but get a real , in doubt the market@@ able opposite , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; by applying for the proposal , three pro@@ pon@@ ents are found . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposite votes in the original program that summ@@ ari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was caught by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told , the 82 @-@ year long Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer Straße . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the landing field asc@@ ended to the street , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met with a car which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital by a retreat .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , personnel care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also refrain from using the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , tut@@ ors Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official pr@@ elu@@ de game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the resin of star to star , &quot;
&quot; in the resin , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; should arise . &quot;
this is what the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many resin @-@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six places &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; I would like to come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels is to be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star was more lumin@@ ous than another , although it was much further away . &quot;
also in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ ture would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ at weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas re@@ marked that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Cli@@ ma asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to agree with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who was interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as an &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held out with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show strokes , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions by Tire Plat@@ zer
&quot; during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car lowered to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the wounded by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed towards the north for about one hour and then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ fl@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result as well , that there weren &apos;t the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that was too much for two opponents , and we have to watch out even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
the three @-@ chain is to be further optimised in the Or@@ e Mountains .
&quot; and a fool according to a fre@@ t , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team knows how to cope better with the tri@@ cycle than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we &apos;re in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford such a lot of playing mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to a storm in Hei@@ den@@ heim too early . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland come as an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Embassy for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Department ( Migration Department ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were under the age of age . &quot;
&quot; up to now , migration verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person &quot; was possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans , to see if they were sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot safely say it , we shouldn &apos;t pret@@ end to be as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is minor . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is close to 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , building manager at the department of road engineering and traffic in the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning reached a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
&quot; this is a border fastening , which is also used as a service path . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges .
particular finger tip feeling has required laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans initially had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting area in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges , together with a total of 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German Pot@@ ato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties are pulling in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which otherwise is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the district of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those , who are already on site for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D meeting in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reported he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ s there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also what it does : at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D @-@ Event lasts somewhat more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9@@ pm . &quot;
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; there is a re@@ union with Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morning , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are the winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the soloist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both combines the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites itself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz club N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything out , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite once in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly with her . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I got . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never conf@@ uses me or hin@@ ders me .
I never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school when she &apos;d rather dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some describe me as und@@ am@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ l@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF con@@ gresses on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away from competitions in gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to repor@@ ters . &quot;
the entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships starting on Friday in London to compete in accordance with the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral Act for Sol@@ di@@ ers in Mali
around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali during a funeral ceremony in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the yet un@@ explained crash .
&quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; drivers of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they furnished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
&quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Vi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the in@@ filtr@@ ated soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and squ@@ at@@ ting .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers were part of the army , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued in the announcement . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; Princ@@ ely Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , explained L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will finally be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met in London in 1965 . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were constantly flo@@ cking , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation to be the company of critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; that was just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament voted for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the unexpected exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their parliament in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its cap on the opposition from the CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ life@@ moved her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , the SPD and the Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled for January 14th .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ dissolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Prime Minister withdraw@@ s the trust and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options have to be legally tested , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ v@@ est &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself emphas@@ ised : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return to their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have received their Land@@ tag mandate , which they received through the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead an pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Saxon Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ owns to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ v@@ est costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate vanity and in her fru@@ stration , the politicians make their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony complic@@ ates this dirty in@@ filtration game and attempts to strike out political funds from it .
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printing .
&quot; at www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected without delay and since the announcement of the embarrass@@ ment of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available for consumers .
&quot; as is the manufacturer , trade has to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if it is exceeded with a maximum of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg in eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production plants are no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too little check@@ ers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
is it missing only on the personnel or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but it was exactly the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy never can be ruled out at 100 per cent . &quot;
this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present is of decisive importance .
I have already pointed out several times that I expect a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and traffic @-@ ready food . &quot;
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; due to the imp@@ acted funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how the Financial Rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 2@@ 22 million ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar sign and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team by the power rich in power of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may spend a lot of money to buy players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources giving them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current 3 @-@ year FF@@ P closing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter rob@@ ber@@ y from excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales figures for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a financial penalty of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ list their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies that are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come from payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambass@@ adors , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generates a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s march by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La league against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect financial fair play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier supplier
choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for Swiss in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; on request of the news agency , Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaging tablets at 14 gram@@ mes distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers before landing .
Swiss does not want to provide any information on the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of the contract according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a toy manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants have submitted to the new tender , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y them . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty over the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ wis@@ s , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
choc@@ ol@@ ates have been distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before closing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ th years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge period ( as the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels as if the time was short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables pronounced by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking on the core of the Day - Ac@@ tor medium @-@ aged children play hor@@ ny children , who will grow up - yet they managed to regain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point is a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy guy called Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the exam is the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as some repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring Game icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ es@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ uting producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ acted to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inated Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against Dru@@ gs @-@ Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared in Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; the officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been conducting a stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ utions in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the heavy duty on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly focused on the Italian ma@@ fia with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way su@@ es large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s Central Register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; was present . &quot;
&quot; according to the Registry , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign @-@ country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data wasn &apos;t properly maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false assignments , however , led to &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient &quot; meaning in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they entered the country . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore says that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF will conduct such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was pointing to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrants return to another EU country , this state can send it back to the Immig@@ ration Office . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human illegal detention conditions and a threat to child welfare due to lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation service for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations now , shared 50 litres of blood . &quot;
traditionally the church hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we want the don@@ ors respect , which make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken into their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Director . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many , Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is said that now it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates it was repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts posted below for this year and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest in interest , and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and negli@@ gible salary increases , since the sharpen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; it added that in the coming years , monetary policy could not &quot; prevent &quot; in@@ comes from in@@ comes , &quot; but it added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will offset a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the base .
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s last verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates has increased since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation last month dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be put on in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent down@@ fall of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those who run out the existing deals and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse , pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld the Supreme Court ruling last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ treatment pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV treatment taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in the case of inf@@ ect@@ ants .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; This great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Ter@@ rence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ alter@@ ing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to make a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot;
living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack her bags and sold it .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan needed to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bite us .
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering work went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite important so that when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to increase the floor space while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square metre number of some standard in something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ a of Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court act states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but also raises Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase in the event involving hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first jeans .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass over their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has with@@ held herself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; just Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much &quot; &quot; because the case was in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President &apos;s abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new staff of staff of the White House , met with senior staff at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media control . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship to television is back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said Sam N@@ un@@ berg &apos;s former election campaign against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
&quot; if his staff managed to keep him away from him for a number of times , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp control .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example written by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it is sti@@ ffer to find out where they originate . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article from Got@@ tw@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold @-@ makers added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kel@@ ly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe will send in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the searched criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the promotion following the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le cur@@ ses are hiding at holiday destinations , the name was Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online counter@@ weights could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate with a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ ms , which have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their mansion houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ej@@ ected in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their attacks . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case .
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is situated in the former Birken@@ hof .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof due to the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer express himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , emphasizes sh@@ ear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances coinci@@ de with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; looking at the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible by the restaurant that is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , the committee took up work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal , &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper stri@@ pped the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already first public inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s äl@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ors of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tru@@ mp personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether the indictment is to be raised .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
&quot; in most cases , they are switched on if they are larger and controversial . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the Office of Public Prosec@@ ution to invite persons to the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster , inv@@ itations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller should not intim@@ id@@ ate himself in his work , and that if necessary , he should act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the setting up of the committee was at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair way . &quot;
&quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this root cause , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey spoke to a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for a hi@@ ring of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President stands under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later @-@ tro@@ dden President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf . &quot;
this announced the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs about 1 tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg , according to research information , it is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom .
ice shelf is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete ice shelf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some evidence that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
&quot; melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and press ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes for observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead to climate change from this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , however , many of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has fallen apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years , thus counting to the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the Krei@@ day saw 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them . &quot;
the courses at the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 6@@ 20 applications were listed for the places that were awarded this year .
&quot; however , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still 50 jobs in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs to skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented of the applicant scar@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is about a regular &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age . &quot;
&quot; the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter colonies , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was already in the circle of a fist @-@ thick surprise , when he questioned the personnel costs in public and ba@@ ff@@ led the other parties ast@@ o@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the communal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not able to find a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tari@@ ffs for the Public Service actually fores@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are now exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees were responsible for the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO Mig@@ rant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that his crew takes on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner outer posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three befri@@ ended guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wery &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shr@@ ines brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breathe in the air @-@ inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters altitude the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga gears up for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium racing with wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included . &quot;
&quot; this has also been recognised by the first German companies , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that many clubs come up on this train . &quot;
&quot; this weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could much more often be present online on these markets than to send the federal debt to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is exactly what is going on ?
&quot; for e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA fought on competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , they have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about the right kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is in need of getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ira has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ee Player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; checks should be difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive manner , the scientist emphasizes the highly integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the Consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales should be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants . &quot;
international are many countries already far@@ ther .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot going on in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ira . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Vice President R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only to decay in no@@ stal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;
the egg @-@ alternatives for cooking and baking
&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the sc@@ andal around pois@@ oned eggs . &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted to all eggs from the sale throughout Germany .
&quot; in regi@@ ments , only eggs are supposed to be taken , which evi@@ dently contain no fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot;
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter condemned for the texts that Con@@ rad Roy forced to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret completely . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my pains that we will be with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person , with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another , commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , one of the few who defended Car@@ ter , was a member of Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was sentenced to life in Italy in 2007 , before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comments : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , isn &apos;t a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern did a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - there is no extra motivation .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ che immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the bond to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t tell it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot;
good that the insurrection could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the sign from the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of things , which one wants to keep in a mood . &quot;
those who have been chosen to compete for the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ ma confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was spotted as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , that is his position , the white binder on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ oto worked in this initial formation as the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ installed tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; V@@ idal , therefore , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches att@@ aches to the de@@ vil@@ s to get out of the performance of the Asian journey ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively charged in their first appearance in the Bavaria jer@@ sey . &quot;
but this worked out quite well .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy was running in front of the army , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was very difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried successfully in the game building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not the way we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance in the debut .
&quot; mod@@ al shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usually this Bavaria World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy didn &apos;t have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i passed after a couple of cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has registered shortly before the game about Twitter and wishes the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is practically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fl@@ et@@ ches with our ladies .
the tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and champi@@ ons League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
the famous Bavarian Dus@@ sel@@ dorf might also need our ladies well .
companies satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ alz State Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ sings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , and Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on the question of a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er@@ ers ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a plan of planning , until 2021 the building law shall stand . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ al spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , there is a sign for supporting regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; as from Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) aims to increase the sales of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that has been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce lo@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed Master &apos;s exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , while at the same time there is no need for the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to employ &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing &quot; &quot; at Landes@@ betrieb Mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce demands to award more jobs to external offices .
&quot; comm@@ enting on calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less than proposed by country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the former broad@@ band expansion in the country would be so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the Wind Power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field because of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president said that &quot; &quot; there are more smart options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust f@@ umes launched by diesel vehicles , too , is also what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of aband@@ oning the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , having accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the examination could hardly pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to join , on the mor@@ nings a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it goes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
and this is not a common raft with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building refer@@ ee wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective wild river . &quot;
last summer the raft passed through the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll &apos;s n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he hit himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist of cities was inspired . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still alive today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches , its dro@@ ll figures continue to be widely spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is more likely to rely on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without wor@@ rying . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and for diseases committed to diseases , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ goats , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the point of view is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval fest .
&quot; cranes , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ inas or a land area should be experienced in the city centre on these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat to Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet in Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break @-@ break from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now , there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , the Commission has only launched two criminal proceedings pursuant to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely presented in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez had left the office of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce newspaper in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; rest &quot; &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , gu@@ essed aisle runners bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to do not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever they were . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who like a port worker could curse , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start @-@ up and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two police officers were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has written three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot;
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was offered as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed resource about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was turned into the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
the media guards Group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; last year accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have elected as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , says that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left behind 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stayed nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers , who held guard to see if they were ready . &quot;
&quot; if they had fear at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you think of closing it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; If on the same day , where J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to sof@@ ten his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ o of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the &quot; Current Biology &quot; magazine described it as &quot; the best @-@ held din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded on March 21 , 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground @-@ cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re only tw@@ inkl@@ ing a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa , the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as a counter@@ attack , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to better blend into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ edly named after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r of enough pressure was ch@@ ased by flesh eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y , which signals that this No@@ dose @-@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in po@@ inters about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ ble @-@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just schi@@ p a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , moved through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded on March 21 , 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater equipment kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the houses still cover b@@ ump@@ y tanks along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
hidden remain@@ ders of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers crossed upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ dness on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ lage .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass @-@ kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age in the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first indications of the police , around 5@@ pm between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there was also massive disabilities on the counter @-@ train - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle @-@ keepers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhau@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ink@@ able or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by means of a mobile phone that one has taken its place and thus vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; when the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will likely be available at many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the App of the Bahn , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customers then show a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that Pas@@ sen@@ ger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train@@ ee arrives at the ticket inspection at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep on , keep on working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train atten@@ dant , checks in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their journey more personal by train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second advantage : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents that one needs for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you have to instruc@@ t .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; are Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her mobile to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a police officer stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas starting from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and Protest@@ anti@@ sm , love and loss , strength and resistance , which is made up of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s figure .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; &quot; docum@@ enting &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to mind : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that &quot; &quot; the movement &quot; &quot; is not a Messiah leader but a community that is coming together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show un@@ expect@@ edly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the person@@ alization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repeatedly repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who vibr@@ ated this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not by chance , although it was in front of the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , news cameras have long gone missing in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , even though it has not been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves the subject cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the other businesses profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always happy . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall res@@ ett@@ les in the gallery is on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping platforms in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is low @-@ priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies , as the rentals of the rented flats are often not portable . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left is likely to disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall be built during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does the Spec@@ tr@@ st Bit @-@ gallery ever manage to sell all the shops out of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping mall , which is empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the crazy many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place any more . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost un@@ notic@@ e@@ ably the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts , sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after public@@ ising diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and away @-@ sent dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had been openly talking about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette silent and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she couldn &apos;t visit her at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she got in touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic book &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Chel@@ ny &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually only calls for a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome form of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and opposing forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid circuits that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the Gallery , Mann@@ ing challenged her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is endowed with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , is written in a pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with me is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novel . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free spy in her hand from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated before in the comic book - but if it should do , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which flock like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who were considered susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the County Court of Cook County show . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several years . &quot;
&quot; a community warning system , published by the Chicago police authority , states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th . &quot;
officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene for dead , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ a has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ it was now being reviewed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ garbage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , which said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident happened on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that loading and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timet@@ able , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no governmental programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the Independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have reiter@@ ated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has prior to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ USA@@ DA had moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore

&quot; from now on only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pro@@ legs anti @-@ lice . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , addressing specific groups and demographic groups , addressing staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases provide whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuit of your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most of the symptoms and which managers have low @-@ tuning results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ ances where those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial engineering website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year among the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send customized &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to notify a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously covered by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or countries have been identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement after the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can grow and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 questions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have committed themselves to collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow people , ask yourself , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you worry about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , saving . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 11 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA footage players chat on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot@@ es and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
&quot; players who are registered at the Summer Courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise , before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning . &quot;
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted practical exercises in West@@ wood for the first time . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 prior to the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they ro@@ cking on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ h@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective enclosure behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then set out to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wishes to intensi@@ fy fact @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with error messages to fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , and then show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may possibly show results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks , if they fail to get rid of hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook told in a separate explanation in German that a test of the new facts started in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fac@@ tual reviews of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his hom@@ ey seat at the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says with one accord . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters smell always after smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who has been beaten up with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; this seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the assembled hybri@@ ds on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with coun@@ cill@@ ors , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rates said , &quot; Oh , cast it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let it go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was later made when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite stub@@ born , getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men sol@@ dered their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise the land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write @-@ experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ hmen , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the announcement of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that something is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one which gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , it stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the City of Bad Honnef will cost a medium five @-@ digit amount to the city of Bad Honnef with its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
&quot; each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension funds and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week too .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after put@@ sch attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the forces of air and the nav@@ y were de@@ posed . &quot;
&quot; since the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have participated directly in the coup attempt , Ankara is negotiating in Ankara this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow of the overthrow as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are concerns on the general staff because of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the cap ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the great care of the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan had further 7@@ 3@@ 95 military servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the army .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they listened to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is systematically pushing forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially not @-@ called officer who sought asylum after put@@ sch from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let Nato get cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army in the alliance after pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the US the way citizens from other countries will be issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for race gate
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the race gate has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train is going to be built will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction work on the track will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; declared the Secretary of Transport Klaus expi@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country is taking 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , is now finally agreed , declared expi@@ ation . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Rail@@ ways are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race @-@ ste@@ er shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection that is popular among tourists between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to re @-@ order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t be even more crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ ford woman would look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah uns@@ ett@@ le one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ s ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will , of course , hold no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is transp@@ iring from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human@@ ly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are frau@@ dul@@ ent slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
is Tru@@ mp@@ s great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp era of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp choosing relations . &quot;
we all re@@ port@@ edly stra@@ y all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , bringing together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser living in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy could have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades of politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the final effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself occupied by an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp is concerned , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Parks section , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ating music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer plenty of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the subject @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could withdraw my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essively gr@@ asp@@ ing , while I we@@ ary had the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs attached to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence following a appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by jumping it several times through a door of the toilet cab@@ s in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they were too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Office said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence is increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door @-@ men from Sag@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in the future , three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; peasant Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken fell , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young goat , the cylinders wore to make the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stands for integration , &quot; said An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ four year old man to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed a word of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching pas@@ sports , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students very reluc@@ tant after two years of teaching , as it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they have been able to rely on the four @-@ door si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight original men are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians det@@ ained in Greece for illegal camp camps , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; the diesel summit offered BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are designed to improve emissions from emissions of emissions from Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives opinions :
is the new action obligatory ?
no . the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the Federal Office of Rail@@ ways ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet named an exact date . &quot;
Daimler reported to write to each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
that depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait .
&quot; foreign manufacturers would probably consult , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
&quot; but in the regions , where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten . &quot;

ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced to refrain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her views . &quot;
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to rent in R@@ ente this year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been . &quot;
and the work still makes him a lot of fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the town looks for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time to famili@@ arise yourself with the regular periods of notice .
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as the Lower Building Law , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate conclusions . &quot;
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill them any longer , citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , looking back at the chi@@ ppers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen @-@ parking lot about are encountered . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be beaten with approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a city master builder . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and nursery , it is possible to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often lau@@ dable by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city @-@ builder bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in the case of support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; he wants his successor to stay long , says W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , should be able to instruc@@ t the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree with speci@@ alisation in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; civil engineering , civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ tak@@ ings , management of urban properties , municipal estate with construction yard and municipal gar@@ dener as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
B@@ ic@@ ycle thrown on lines : South Rail@@ road blocked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
&quot; close to the crime scene , a sco@@ oter driver and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , had brought themselves into great danger , and also endangered the transport of the train . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay in delay and the costs for rail @-@ moving goods , also pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , a &quot; substantial &quot; amount would be assumed , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway line could be carried out without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten people , Friday morning dropped off , two of them concerned the traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains failed , but they delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes ga@@ stri@@ c cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a type of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doctoral Fel@@ ine Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om@@ ics of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria looked to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then delivered small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes associated with tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people mar@@ ched at will like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; apart from M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho entered its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
so the number 7@@ 87 and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democr@@ at prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - thus lau@@ ded the most important desire of the elec@@ tive fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Mr Schulz did from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach by head@@ wind .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising conclusion of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General , Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ et exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Austrian Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ rou@@ d to give back her mand@@ ates .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est immediately needs to give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal managing director and election director of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that must not be true all at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ jac@@ king achieved the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the transition of green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ owns . &quot;
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the failure began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was , too - and everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to go out , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cut the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; lab@@ ori@@ ously , the comrades ra@@ ged again in the weeks afterwards . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next set@@ back .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because in the communication of crisis he got pretty much wrong about what to do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ type and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese conversion values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just that , Because in the past weeks Wei@@ l tried to set up acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and does not Schulz at all .
&quot; at times , comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own car@@ eers over the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been any more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy for local core III
those who want to be in the house in the years can soon receive support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed themselves on Wednesday . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler again gave a review of what happened so far .
&quot; since 1991 , there have been several remedi@@ ation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurbish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the remedi@@ ation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the total amount was € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500 000 Euro came from the country , the rest of the congregation . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area created ?
&quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel represented the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the remedi@@ ation area would eventually be defined as a statute .
the grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking will be carried out only once , in the framework of those participating in the remedi@@ ation area to fill a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statutes shall be made possible , so that the renovation can begin in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned screening examinations . &quot;
&quot; it is about evaluating and assessing the conditions of urban@@ ism , and to decide when it will be restored and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a note in the land register for the respective land .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to his own feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ tw@@ ald emphas@@ ised that the project is a key success factor for the project .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot arc &quot; , &quot; in which it works , among other things , the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and habit@@ ants of a residential space can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; can only be filled if premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ hart pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
&quot; one cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location kern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs impl@@ anting micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now built in at home as well as his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights US manufacturing last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost up to $ 24@@ ,000 according to the military information provided to the TI@@ ME magazine . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it &apos;s such an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ commander of Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long remained until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents shall be required to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation into the presidential plane against the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area , in order to set the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter sets . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential &quot; &quot; missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
record of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
of course it is appropriate to emphasize this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
leaders of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga compete in the third quarter of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has maintained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent at any rate .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; in the post@@ erior position , I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup bets .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this is as always difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; in the competition in the Czech Liber@@ ec player Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , the Czech Liber@@ ec player ( Czech Republic ) , who is currently playing in the competition in the Czech Liber@@ ec , manages to compete in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owe , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the trainer um Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to intensi@@ fy the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , the Congress had wrapped up a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , which together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian eastern sou@@ ther@@ ing North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threatening scenery is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; viewed which the group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first tra@@ ilers and showed the newest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch itself .
with permanent contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day @-@ care centers , the watch is turned back . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth aid department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the house , a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh Gek@@ o@@ chte blankets . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at mid@@ day . &quot;
&quot; in the past year of kit@@ ing , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 week hours , eat in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 p.m .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , pour out the food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ - as well as sevent@@ een units - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more involved and it is easier to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts for the implementation of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , this variant also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between own reg@@ ie and foreign lending for the city , it is called the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with about 750 people in the area of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , &quot; &quot; says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eling in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

&quot; according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with their friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , but they failed . &quot;

the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had weigh@@ ed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces plan@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits besides other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and union representatives would &quot; be the first to experience if their activities change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent work in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow desper@@ ately needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; it added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and entirely . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La league likes to repent of Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be ref@@ unded in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , having given an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but have it warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record collapse ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans Board insist@@ ed that the club always gave his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world been warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter revers@@ ed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator deliberately dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the estate number 30 and so on the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle damage of more than 200 Euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es . &quot;
&quot; to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the lead . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um came from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 19.@@ 55 P.@@ M. towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the lead . &quot;
&quot; in the passenger car , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking for witnesses to the incident , as well as the driver of the cause plane to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother George R@@ atz@@ inger .
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann refers to this .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ ss@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he acquired from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ tor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience , preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; says Scar@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; pun@@ ches had been a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gical tool &quot; in their youth , &quot; to deal with nau@@ ghty children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on abuse cases , pop@@ e brother George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the mem@@ or@@ ative book &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? &quot;
&quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , we can say that by many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotional quality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims of the general humanity of R. appreciated , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence , they even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against protected victims at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many disciples highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of accompli@@ ce or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can reproach him at best , to experience it too late or to have taken first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provide an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by kids &quot; grapes . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which even led to frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in doing so he did not only cr@@ ush with chairs and threw the key and ears on the floor , but also laid ears on the ears or ears , he himself admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and in teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state secondary school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not rather with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian pop@@ e many , who have never understood him , are still eager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , a lot has been reported on the topic of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in the context of the report . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also attach some involvement or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said one affected person , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the real problem in raising sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Stu@@ dents R@@ atz@@ inger know their role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it is ... even for really absurd , to assume that it is counting from him ... Bu@@ b im@@ penet@@ r@@ able or clearer or even more open than vis @-@ à @-@ vis their parents , dormit@@ ory directors , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report came to the very clear result : &quot; that in the run @-@ up , the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , George R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any co @-@ workers . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing or delivering it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; had to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but precisely this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is perfectly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral head of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful education ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , and were horri@@ fied , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; but with whom he had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he only got the boy on his face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses say , the topic &quot; &quot; Pre@@ par@@ ative school &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; many victims inv@@ alu@@ able the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut his ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out the fact that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , as each of us knows still . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but one cannot say that he would have always looked away .
this is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test @-@ penalty for schools was aboli@@ shed in Bavaria as well . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to current moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was too shy at all times , and also not for what was obstruc@@ ted in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond what was then practi@@ sed then . &quot;
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , ear @-@ cow@@ ls and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture from his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject test drive also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , that the dom@@ ites only played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t mean by no means that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , you don &apos;t have a great singer from a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy and stand in front of every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; what kind of man did you experience , for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , during the talks to her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , very good , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly see how many former dom@@ ites still keep contact with him , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ation , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the dom@@ ites are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a respect@@ ful dis@@ respect@@ ful person , to which they are still looking up today and whom they almost ad@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all that is proposed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , would finally be in peace . &quot;
