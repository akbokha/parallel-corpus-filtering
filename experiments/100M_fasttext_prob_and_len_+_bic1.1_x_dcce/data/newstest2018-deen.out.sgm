<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A GruftChapel which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that can be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and communities, more detailed maps, so-called primeval leaflets, were incorporated into the large overview map."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian survey administration, this arose between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops migrated with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The official leaflet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Fruits / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is the sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the city is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a small-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered fleeces from the so-called" "uranium" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots are no longer evidence of farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "Gasteig" "or" "On the Lüftwards" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüven" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the buying of the so-called madman."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was first place for 280 patients, but later, 500 seats were added."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric services, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Salesianum in Munich meet on the grounds of the former floodlight.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west lies the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the Children's House" Casa Don Bosco "was constructed in an architectural style based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War with bombings."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstraße name was" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages, once stood at Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn family route took place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fisheries has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "says the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law from Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, led the group to publish the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people pass through."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped because of their skin color, they are killed or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear grievances in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri State Attorney Office, showing that black motorists in the state will be more common than whites in the state."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring it to chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states committed immigration laws to arrest people for violations of immigration which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezaun-Project is a project of success and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies in the cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengasste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest's milk "is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales only come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the Chairman of the Fischbach BLHV, he described the fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area for a lot of work, much has to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he does not conduct biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture, and are concerned about how they will continue their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which must not be explored until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted over leader, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of Weidezvn."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the durability of the fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job without farmers and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also stood firm:" "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Service Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art funding of grassland fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a subsidy posted by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area should not be feasible (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 Fischerbacher WeidezvaunProject, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals to drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it took its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it was added as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller elaped Acosta," I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the poor waste of your rich shores. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elemental rubbish" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they were performing a high-political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should demonstrate the ties between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatism, which brings the American flame into the world's surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elemental, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black praised Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when only two Scotsman belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes" "something special in Scotland" "and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh got, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scotsmen are in the UK team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The Mittelstrackenwalker Muir leads on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be mixed with the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me, it makes something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to get on stage."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the resetting of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew somewhat of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate on the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are considered by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees referred to as" "concentrated spamming spam" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleting a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or to silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable portos had a similar impact on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of letters hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belisarius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, which last year led in the Archerfield links to the final round, before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved fame with this event," "said Rafferty."</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great state."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry did a great job when he set out this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="215">"that really feels special," "said the player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it."</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to his home base."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you're playing at home," "said Orr, the man from Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am glad about the way it was done.</seg>
<seg id="227">"with the trio in the field, the former master winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNine."</seg>

<seg id="449">"in a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruiting proposed that his reversal in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indicted by activists and others, and in an agreement to determine the deadline for carrying out," said Pruiting, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job. "</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take fright seriously."</seg>
<seg id="452">"we also take the law and authority, which gives it to us, seriously."</seg>
<seg id="453">"nevertheless, the statement of the EPA that Pruitt eventually will use his" authority to delay and all other legally available authority "to ensure that the rules" are based on a solid policy and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republican Congress is pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The decision was not yet made to vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">"the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states complaining the EPA this week, said the group intended to uphold the legal pressure."</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "said Schneiderman."</seg>
<seg id="459">"in this case, New York included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia."</seg>

<seg id="461">"the resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths."</seg>
<seg id="462">Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitts surprising course change.</seg>
<seg id="463">"it is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhale," "said Lori Ann Burd from Center for Biological Diversity."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a Serenade on Sunday 16th July, at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in the year 1267 the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in the Württembergischer's original customer book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church of Tumlingen, together with the vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document, on the hill of Tumlingen apart from the former parish church, there was also a splendid courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt dating back to 1858, was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "the third, the settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around 1600 underpin these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval peculiarity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a Lord, who built a church and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in doing so, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were carved and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they broke out the pulpit and the church-bases, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm collapsed and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-building still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Weiner cultivate the Hilarius plant as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of the St. HilariusChapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim defends itself" does not foresee a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim resists" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind force concentration zone."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent a "asparation" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government, because of a formist."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also to take back," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim. "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter entered the circle of Viersen last week," "declared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity consumption is expected to be covered by some 11 400 households - that is roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen Stadler gave green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really inconceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the post-job."</seg>

<seg id="641">"until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when one stands in the same country where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children squat their heads, record the faked blood and the silent bodies and whispers one to another."</seg>

<seg id="684">"amount: normally in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I will help in Greven in the furniture bridge."</seg>
<seg id="685">And I have already worked in the open full day at the school.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">"it's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here."</seg>
<seg id="688">"I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults."</seg>
<seg id="689">"they are now 26 years, so a later-called volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Quantity: I did SLC.</seg>

<seg id="693">"I know for myself that it is the wrong for me, and I want to do something different, work with people."</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">"make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it is on the spot, at the focal point maybe also, really."</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">In the winter semester I will start my studies in the social system.</seg>
<seg id="699">"I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences."</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">"yes, it is very variable."</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where you are doing the FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">"I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care."</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really expires.</seg>
<seg id="708">Other than in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">"a lot: well, here it is not about calculating stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="710">"one always has other people in the head, each having a different story behind them."</seg>
<seg id="711">"whether a refugee, whether an adolescent who has been taken out of the family, must always be individually addressed."</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And they had no reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">"for that, I am not the guy."</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>

<seg id="742">"Pruiting announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the ozone regulations - in which in part of the country, pollutant emissions are to be measured in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018."</seg>
<seg id="743">"a group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal."</seg>

<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes, the municipal council of Fluorn Winds decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjade."</seg>

<seg id="752">"one of the two investors, who are still in the boat, offered to meet the community."</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the council are hovering to see such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorous housing, but openly in the church."</seg>
<seg id="755">"for example, the word" "knitting café" "made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn, by means of funding."</seg>
<seg id="757">The construction is in the refurbishment area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"the establishment of a shared space would be, as reported Tjades, capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent."</seg>

<seg id="760">"needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer says, be this addition."</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: unanimously he passes the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>

<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It is behind a concealed subsidy of already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface you don't give a grant, but get a real, in doubt the marketable opposite, that is the counter-speech."</seg>

<seg id="799">There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="800">"a" "star trail" "comes to meet the need for information of many resin-goers."</seg>
<seg id="801">"he combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance."</seg>
<seg id="802">The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">"in a first phase until 2018, the association plans" "well-accessible installations at five to six places" "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"I would like to come to St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the panels is to be supplemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the" "starpath" "should be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starpath the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. "</seg>
<seg id="810">"they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star was more luminous than another, although it was much further away."</seg>
<seg id="811">Also in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">"since 2014, the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the highest observatory in Northern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="813">"according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation, the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">"since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Trail."</seg>
<seg id="816">"starting from Gebhard Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an" extraterrestrial "location in Diemarden (Municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna."</seg>
<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the dwarf-planed Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">"the earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="820">"while the light from sun to Pluto requires about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto."</seg>

<seg id="861">"after the 2: 2 season opener Hoffmann hopes for the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defenses in Aue points brings."</seg>
<seg id="862">"with the first match of the season, Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result as well, that there weren't the two opponents at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"that was too much for two opponents, and we have to watch out even better in Aue," says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">The three-chain is to be further optimised in the Ore Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a fool according to a fret, the Fortunas don't want to catch up anymore."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team knows how to cope better with the tricycle than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how we will act in Aue," "says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause," "because we're in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we do not afford such a lot of playing mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a failed start, you don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be okay," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His coach didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who didn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to a storm in Heidenheim too early. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season virtually with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know that 100% where they are at present," "says the inner defender of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland come as an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with just a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which one has to beat from the start," explains Fortunas chief coach. "</seg>
<seg id="881">To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.</seg>

<seg id="884">"the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Embassy for Forensic Medicine (Rättmedicinalverket) has begun the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Department (Migration Department) has been criticised for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were under the age of age."</seg>
<seg id="887">"up to now, migration verket has sent 6,880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person" was possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Goransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we do not see a big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans, to see if they were sooner or later than usual by puberty."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot safely say it, we shouldn't pretend to be as if we could," he said to the newspaper Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is minor. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the greatest risk is when the person is close to 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the executive organization that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid €222 million (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can easily make the money loose so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team by the power rich in power of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may spend a lot of money to buy players, but have to counteract with legitimate income sources giving them the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current 3-year FFP closing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter robbery from excessive expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales figures for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a financial penalty of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies that are associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels as if the time was short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables pronounced by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>

<seg id="1237">"such false assignments, however, led to" a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient "meaning in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with less than 16-year-old children when they entered the country."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving to increase in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that interest rates would be necessary in the next few years to curb the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic package, which was issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it is said that now it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" "in the central forecasting of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be burdened by consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates it was repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required for cooling inflation and a" somewhat greater "scale than the markets expected."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that elevations would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts posted below for this year and next year will be 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of interest in interest, and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months has risen to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and negligible salary increases, since the sharpening becomes even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"it added that in the coming years, monetary policy could not" prevent "incomes from incomes," but it added that the wages for the end of their three-year forecast will be "clearly" recuperated. "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to weak pounds, which will offset a portion of lower consumer spending."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the sinking of the base.</seg>
<seg id="1284">"the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years, until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's last verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates has increased since inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation last month dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be put on in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "given the recent downfall of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for businesses and end the year in a positive way."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly well for those who run out the existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse, pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court upheld the Supreme Court ruling last year, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the prep despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretreatment prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV treatment taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in the case of infectants.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will receive £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said," This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-altering infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us to make a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society." "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold it.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan needed to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bite us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering work went in," explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite important so that when you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperia of Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as" the main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, like Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but also raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs increase in the event involving hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass over their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are, Paul says," "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin has withheld herself very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"just Colin responded by SMS to say" "I can't really say much" "because the case was in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw up our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight," "he said, adding that he still hope for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of staff of the White House, met with senior staff at his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media control."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television is back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," said Sam Nunberg's former election campaign against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff managed to keep him away from him for a number of times, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump control.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story, reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it is stiffer to find out where they originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article from Gottw.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," being the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"gold-makers added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry residents have urged the council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is situated in the former Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, building shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer express himself."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, emphasizes shearers."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourist director Michael Krause, as Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances coincide with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"looking at the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to specify exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is accessible by the restaurant that is public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in the past few weeks, the committee took up work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal, "calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper stripped the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already first public invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps äldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin for a long time interfering with the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted as advisors of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trumps private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether the indictment is to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are switched on if they are larger and controversial."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the Office of Public Prosecution to invite persons to the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN broadcaster, invitations were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps's advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team leader Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting show that Mueller should not intimidate himself in his work, and that if necessary, he should act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the setting up of the committee was at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the democrats a chance to" feel good, "because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair way."</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI chief James Comey said three times, that not against the President."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this root cause, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey spoke to a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a hiring of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair about the later-trodden President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented the draft laws on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This announced the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, which weighs about 1 trillion and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg, according to research information, it is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelstrom.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelstrom is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disrupted a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete ice shelf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that even the Larsen-C-Schelstrom is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and press ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes for observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelstrom is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct link to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "he also confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C-ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead to climate change from this gigantic iceberg, however, many of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years, thus counting to the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU asks to step out of the employers' association in order to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"just before the summer break, the Kreiday saw 41 new jobs in the administration."</seg>

<seg id="1555">The courses at the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were listed for the places that were awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"however, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 jobs in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs to skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented of the applicant scarcity."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, showing concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is about a regular" "competition of the public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"the highest time for action, so that no more places remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter colonies, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he was already in the circle of a fist-thick surprise, when he questioned the personnel costs in public and baffled the other parties astounded."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the communal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we are not able to find a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns," "said peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tariffs for the Public Service actually foresee."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are now exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees were responsible for the provisions of the new prostitution protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone on NGO Migrant lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organisation in an opinion on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is presumed that his crew takes on board dinghy migrants who are delivered directly from human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and the cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three befriended guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- und Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewing points, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, a lookout point at the lookout point, connected by" flowery "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shrines brought welcome breaks."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in the future, the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of being sweating through the stadium racing with wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also been recognised by the first German companies, who are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young audiences for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," that many clubs come up on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"this weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup", "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could much more often be present online on these markets than to send the federal debt to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is exactly what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"for e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just the football simulation of FIFA fought on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, they have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about the right kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is in need of getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobira has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fee Player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobber also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"checks should be difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive manner, the scientist emphasizes the highly integrative effect of E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the way, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales should be at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however," e-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte Consultants. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already farther.</seg>

<seg id="1649">There is a lot going on in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the football-first league clubs according to Dutt are now obliged to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany lags behind," explains VfB Vice President Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only to decay in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," "says Dutt."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend by texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing:" "my family is uncomforting."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes, when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they regret completely."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that" "there is no day when I don't feel the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for eternity despite all my pains that we will be with us for eternity." ""</seg>

<seg id="1679">"no longer have this single person, with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to claim another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote," You must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the coach didn't tell it," "said the Confed-Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern captain."</seg>
<seg id="1695">Good that the insurrection could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi could also interpret the sign from the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen by youth players, debutants and just out of vacation professionals existing C-Elf as a game guide, but he."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of things, which one wants to keep in a mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who have been chosen to compete for the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimma confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old was spotted as a mini-lamm over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"to the right rear, that is his position, the white binder on the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kimoto worked in this initial formation as the one who can best take the helm."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the uninstalled troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal, therefore, to replay his missing fitness (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches attaches to the devils to get out of the performance of the Asian journey (foldable also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle are not negatively charged in their first appearance in the Bavaria jersey."</seg>
<seg id="1707">But this worked out quite well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimme, Rudy was running in front of the army, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the renowned Napoli-storm was very difficult, and Süle also tried successfully in the game building a few times."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy admitted that" "the result" "was not the way we were hoping for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a good performance in the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"modal shift, tempo change:" for this style I was also picked up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as unusually this Bavaria World is still for the newcomers, one saw in the connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy didn't have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi passed after a couple of crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard from Süle an interesting sentence:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green), and Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">"this is reflected in more than a year, in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office."</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on the question of a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierers (VTU), says:" "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal of the reversal sees natus in infrastructure policy: the bridging of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the ministry is hoping for a plan of planning, until 2021 the building law shall stand."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the Westumgehung of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"of course, there is a sign for supporting regional, but international competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"as from Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) aims to increase the sales of a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that has been sagging for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1737">"the Handwerkskammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach."</seg>
<seg id="1738">"a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed Master's exam and 2500 Euros, if graduates are self-employed within ten years after the master training."</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road construction is quick to create facts, while at the same time there is no need for the country at the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers, who want to employ" "Wissing" "at Landesbetrieb Mobility."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce demands to award more jobs to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">"commenting on calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros less than proposed by country roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a country's concept to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the former broadband expansion in the country would be sobering."</seg>

<seg id="1751">"one day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1752">"the BMW-president said that" "there are more smart options than driving restrictions," "referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1753">"on Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions."</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but the nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralisation of exhaust fumes launched by diesel vehicles, too, is also what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of abandoning the mighty car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but returning to normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"at the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, having accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded."</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the examination could hardly pollute Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the benefit of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break-break from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now, there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Commission has only launched two criminal proceedings pursuant to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely presented in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez had left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "twelfth river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" "rest" "when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, guessed aisle runners bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to do not compel Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever they were."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the fun bird, who like a port worker could curse, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, was his love for routine his ruin?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-up and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two police officers were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has written three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state expenditures, which concentrated on the governor's hometown."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was offered as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed resource about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was turned into the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing down in organized protests" SOS Press "on walking paths and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media guards Group "Articulo 19" last year accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have elected as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicized the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, like the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with belt rivets and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left behind 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curb edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens stayed nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez cast a look at the police officers, who held guard to see if they were ready."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they had fear at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the" Current Biology "magazine described it as" the best-held dinosaurs, ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he founded on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy ground-clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only twinkling a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa, the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as a counterattack, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markedly named after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the shape of scales and armor over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shade is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur of enough pressure was chased by flesh eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, which signals that this Nodose-rier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous dinosaur predators have to have been the chalk time," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in pointers about his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Noble-rier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just schip a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, moved through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he founded on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the houses still cover bumpy tanks along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Hidden remainders of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers crossed upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1976">"at first, there are no indications of the exact number of injured."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a light to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: exhauf.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsinkable or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms by means of a mobile phone that one has taken its place and thus validates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will likely be available at many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "calls the train card devaluation without Schaffner."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the App of the Bahn, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" "comfort check-in" "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket to" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers then show a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the trainee arrives at the ticket inspection at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already validated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can sleep on, keep on working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers. "</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel relaxed without ticketing through our train attendant, checks in the DB Navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their journey more personal by train," says Michael Peterson, Head of Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second advantage:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travellers not all the documents that one needs for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you have to instruct.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2018">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "are Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police just killed a 18 year old child, and it is still on the street," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her mobile to return to tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people screaming, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a police officer stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried," I will kill you... animals all. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas starting from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and Protestantism, love and loss, strength and resistance, which is made up of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had" "over the black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "documenting" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to mind:" do you want to document, or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project nearer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years following Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that" "the movement" "is not a Messiah leader but a community that is coming together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the personalization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's story repeatedly repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identified the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who vibrated this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not by chance, although it was in front of the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, news cameras have long gone missing in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers are discussing bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, even though it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves the subject cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit-gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the other businesses profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "for many years we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall resettles in the gallery is on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping platforms in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is low-priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies, as the rentals of the rented flats are often not portable."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left is likely to disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market hall be built during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the Spectrst Bit-gallery ever manage to sell all the shops out of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping mall, which is empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no place any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost unnoticeably the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts, sent to her by Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publicising diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has combined their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and away-sent dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had been openly talking about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette silent and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she couldn't visit her at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she got in touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic book" "Suppressed Images," "illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would convert Chelny's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually only calls for a few days after the book was released, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome form of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and opposing forces to find new, tweetable ways to solve the rigid circuits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the Gallery, Manning challenged her oversized signature (the" i "in her surname is endowed with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, is written in a pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with me is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free spy in her hand from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech, they have won," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated before in the comic book - but if it should do, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which flock like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haploids were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a country-wide human hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who were considered suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the County Court of Cook County show."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several years."</seg>
<seg id="2162">"a community warning system, published by the Chicago police authority, states that the corpse was discovered on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell Duranleau was declared dead at the scene for dead, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Laa has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lait was now being reviewed and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubgarbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, which said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident happened on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that loading and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - deceitful."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of human resources start-ups is on the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, addressing specific groups and demographic groups, addressing staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases provide whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>

<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360 degree view into the experience with employment," "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday."</seg>

<seg id="2231">"companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it took until the" social media came to their right, "that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry."</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obligated to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both Convercent and Glint.

<seg id="2244">"when the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement after the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, when a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, these disappointments can grow and motivate employees."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 questions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies who have committed themselves to collecting data. "</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted practical exercises in Westwood for the first time."</seg>

<seg id="2272">"I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lushkin Center, a hotel of upscale class that has already cleared a protective enclosure behind a doorpost, will not be an easy task."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his homey seat at the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, British May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters smell always after smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the assembled hybrids on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with councillors, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "says Rhodes."</seg>

<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that 2017 can't be even more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adjust" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that a stepford woman would look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (means: reluctant) Farrah unsettle one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxwith a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxs?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will, of course, hold no sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is transpiring from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are fraudulent slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>

<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser living in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy could have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades of politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me that this also brings considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the final effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his kittens will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing," normalized, "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of reasonableness."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"the diesel summit offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are designed to improve emissions from emissions of emissions from Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 emissions.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives opinions:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No. the software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofit has ordered the Federal Office of Railways (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"the manufacturers have announced speedy implementation in the coming months, but not yet named an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler reported to write to each person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the framework."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the conversions take place altogether?</seg>

<seg id="2508">That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, the car manufacturers do not act on the topic of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming it could be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">"what do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?"</seg>

<seg id="2541">The town looks for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time to familiarise yourself with the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the Administrative Community as the Lower Building Law, the applicant must instruct appropriate conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill them any longer, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but closeness to the city is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens."</seg>

<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own farm and nursery, it is possible to react flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often laudable by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city building master emphasizes."</seg>

<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything runs here over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"in the case of support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing business for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes gastric cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctoral Feline Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomics of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria looked to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then delivered small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2673">"in addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development informed themselves on Wednesday."</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"since 1991, there have been several remediation areas."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the remediation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovations are a" "successful project" "- it is important to promote internal development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the government presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a remediation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the total amount was €833 333, of which 500 000 Euro came from the country, the rest of the congregation."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a remediation area created?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"so Schindler will continue to investigate where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the regional boundaries could then be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel represented the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme" "Social City", "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the stocktaking will be carried out only once, in the framework of those participating in the remediation area to fill a questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statutes shall be made possible, so that the renovation can begin in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann declared that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned screening examinations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is about evaluating and assessing the conditions of urbanism, and to decide when it will be restored and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a note in the land register for the respective land.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will again come to his own feelings and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gottwald emphasised that the project is a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow Questionnaire is the" "building and plot arc", "in which it works, among other things, the structural condition and the remediation views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" "household and housing", "data on size, division and habitants of a residential space can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "Worksheet" can only be filled if premises are operated in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be noted, Gothart pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not conducive."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding according to the" "greyhound principle" "- who comes first, grinds first."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"one cannot reserve funds for later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2706">"finally, photos of the project" "Location kern II" "were shown to make the present a" "tasty" "renovation."</seg>

<seg id="2708">"a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"Steven Northam, 33, implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"he joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard."</seg>
<seg id="2711">The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanting microchip and takes only 30 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights US manufacturing last month, taxpayers will cost up to $24,000 according to the military information provided to the TIME magazine."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House's Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with great visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Marinekomcommander of Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m., and so long remained until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you were locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents shall be required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump carried out an investigation into the presidential plane against the background of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">"HMX-1 crews frequently carry training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area, in order to set the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sets."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, the Helikopter units flew 11 hours on that day for" "non-presidential" "missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in setting helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refunds is highly misleading," Walters said. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire fighter."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2813">"for this reason, it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons."</seg>

<seg id="2849">A union would like to make a long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.</seg>
<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said that the company had weighed about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.</seg>
<seg id="2851">"more than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces plannobs and rich tea biscuits besides other products."</seg>
<seg id="2852">McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="2853">He added that workers and union representatives would "be the first to experience if their activities change.</seg>
<seg id="2854">"in a letter to the company's manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's insisted on" "expressing concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy, said:" "the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerned with our members."</seg>
<seg id="2856">"generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent work in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage."</seg>
<seg id="2857">"therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie."</seg>

<seg id="2866">"the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police are now asking for witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the cause plane to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on Tel. 05761 / 92060."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse relieves Pope's brother George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Author and historian Michael Hesemann refers to this.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he acquired from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral captor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it is" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience, preparing public opinion to keep it normal," "says Scarafa."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "we are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that" punches had been a quite normal pedagogical tool "in their youth," to deal with naughty children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on abuse cases, pope brother George Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger wrote the memorative book" "My brother the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take the protection of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly stands in the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said that Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, we can say that by many cases, Domkapellmeister R. has been employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotional quality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims of the general humanity of R. appreciated, and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence, they even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against protected victims at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many disciples highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist who became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of accomplice or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him at best, to experience it too late or to have taken first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provide an excellent testimony, describes him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by kids "grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which even led to fractures."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"in doing so he did not only crush with chairs and threw the key and ears on the floor, but also laid ears on the ears or ears, he himself admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this is certainly dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not rather with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope many, who have never understood him, are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, a lot has been reported on the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen in the context of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also attach some involvement or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "said one affected person," "It was all very embarrassing for me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in raising sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen Students Ratzinger know their role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable pupil formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it is... even for really absurd, to assume that it is counting from him... Bub impenetrable or clearer or even more open than vis-à-vis their parents, dormitory directors, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report came to the very clear result:" that in the run-up, the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, George Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any co-workers."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing or delivering it."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflicting crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" excesses "had to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "looking away" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But precisely this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is perfectly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses as well as, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral head of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful education pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and maligned, and were horrified, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom he had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boy on his face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses say, the topic" "Preparative school" "tabou."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "many victims invaluable the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger shut his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out the fact that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, as each of us knows still."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test-penalty for schools was abolished in Bavaria as well."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfall of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to current moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was too shy at all times, and also not for what was obstructed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then practised then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, i.e., ear-cowls and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture from his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "My brother the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test drive also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, that the domites only played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't mean by no means that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, you don't have a great singer from a rebellious boy and stand in front of every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of man did you experience, for Georg Ratzinger, during the talks to her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, very good, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom one can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly see how many former domites still keep contact with him, 23 years after his emeritiation, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the domites are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a respectful disrespectful person, to which they are still looking up today and whom they almost adore."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all that is proposed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be in peace."</seg>
