J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality .
I myself have not the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , vor@@ m TV with a lo@@ cker@@ ful de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film will start with us starting 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted back home to the fo@@ dder in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with that the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he had his family run over the complex of AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even sp@@ ill himself for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen and with it also with the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting event was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala of the Golden Ath@@ lete Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of distinc@@ tions to the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lor@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th Win@@ ner of the pyramid of Sports is a long one .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was included in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes are Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt small and warn of how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will make a massive return on regulations , and he will be strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying . &quot;
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the government @-@ critical issue of the Republi@@ can Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp there could be even party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ press coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement intends to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with its investment program , Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy and claim : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both however , both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , rather than simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ end , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp stands , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics point out to him that the budget deficit would only increase .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother is star@@ ing at the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a provider of social aid programmes in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodation for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs visited the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh the other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , moral murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs ask for a bottle of water a sexual act , is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , is mistaken , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not develop voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it requires more accommodation for them only , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for receiving refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich , some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection , can be read by the crowd who gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance physicians argue : demands for new employment campaigns
Deputy Prime Ministers have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment policies in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employment policies from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to deal with the concerns about the treaty .
&quot; in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating employment campaigns starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians were struck by six times this year , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA Assistant Doctor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he informed B@@ MA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced forci@@ bly . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands , and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be very pal@@ p@@ able , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s eman@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state forgot nothing . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin wi@@ ped out and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
&quot; building up the unc@@ le is difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media had a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan , primarily , needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television forecasts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; for this purpose , the continuing gru@@ dge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an analy@@ st , an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that were driven away from the West and badly treated and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they would not even have touched the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are talking at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s board of directors , the R@@ BS brand shall only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumers &quot; brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national stamps into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock exchange are going to change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will gain more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer be carried out and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bench for our customers and they would have launched these stamps .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves his 3.@@ 000@@ th earnings at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double by New@@ market , which brings 3,000 gain to it &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Swiss D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market . &quot;
he set a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night on his local rac@@ et@@ rack .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who was in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picking up the che@@ er when he reco@@ vers victory on Pre@@ fl@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the steep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which distinguishes him from the others in the control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and Grand Prix jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years winner in UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat@@ race for two decades now . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of Grand Prix winners , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he &apos;s not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin fires chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his head of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest acquain@@ tance . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Vice President of Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , was named his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Estonian Capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
&quot; Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o , as his successor , recommended . &quot;
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the narrow@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin and working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the general elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complain posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian president for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people to whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , closest ally coup , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
&quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president again three and a half years later . &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .

&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be sandals for the 75 fish that were mirr@@ ored by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ or Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; ceiling b@@ lower , &quot; which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all the witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the brid@@ ge@@ deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , nearly 79 % of the total de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the shutter is forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; following the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the shore . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct has a length of 2@@ 22 metres , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; un@@ cles , because the tolerances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only ru@@ ined a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
three men are lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown off from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat turned around and set the worst before , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast@@ guard and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness and still being alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
hard hurt - man sm@@ ells on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic do@@ er cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; in the future , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think : investors should be taken much more seriously in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept for living &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot;
but arguments are programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann points out : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas has to point out 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favourable dwell@@ ings can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing support programme , which will cost millions of dollars and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to set investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , as viol@@ a , a tightening of the situation on the housing market is v@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is still not entirely : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one look like the loss of more than 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning politi@@ cian Nicole Palm , should now buy out @-@ going bind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West City .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; for in the west city , the year @-@ end dates exp@@ ire . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West City is increased dr@@ astically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go by boat . &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer spending their free time , star@@ ing on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially restricted to TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( later it created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken prisoner . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person sets back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are play@@ things that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
there has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be ref@@ illed over time .
&quot; due to Pok@@ emon &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
st@@ unn@@ ingly on the ground .
on entire line brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ki@@ cked off on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ sts Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Women &apos;s Sim@@ one Bil@@ es ra@@ ves on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the artistic gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she rein@@ forces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has the last three years of her sport dominated , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue one said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi@@ camp of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the reti@@ ring team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tum@@ bling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not accidental .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot;
&quot; even when Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture mur@@ mu@@ red . &quot;
Swedish bars and boy@@ cot@@ ts - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she returned with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her end @-@ to @-@ face - pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ aine , who is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise she threw down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer sn@@ apshots while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks from Phoenix ever since they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots of a hand @-@ gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police told that thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; all in all , seven people were killed in His@@ panic living quarters within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they had concluded that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which ended up half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder , and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;

I do not create it .
I didn &apos;t let go of it .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund couldn &apos;t sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he can still not speak .

it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund advoc@@ ated for &quot; Please sing something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for a prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;

&quot; severe rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were growing . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ b @-@ areas near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State limit in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still tied people out of the flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ be on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a rise in the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been fully absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and educational trip in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now flooded .
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated ones . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags made available to the inhabitants for taking part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported to be flooded , but no signs were reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; qu@@ en@@ ched by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he did a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ end@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was cri@@ tically classified in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge he@@ els for storm guns , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ looked the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the way , there were tubes . &quot;
&quot; in this way , several armed fighters have appeared here who were very actively involved , &quot; said police det@@ achment Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a crus@@ her on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I propose to myself under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Gymn@@ as@@ tics Federation and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is catho@@ lic , completes , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won Gold at an individual multi@@ camp event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but it does not look like gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four female tur@@ ners in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns are an expensive sport and gymn@@ as@@ tics primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , alignment , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities out innum@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easily accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my gym 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance physicians would like to organise other strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt plans had revealed plans to introduce the contract forci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; No Man Land &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first dentists are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend endar@@ s to improve the maintenance of the schedule . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the B@@ MA Committee for Assist@@ ants , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty , particularly that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and it will be agreed to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is running . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve the disputes resulting from discussions met with the government on re@@ vocation and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the condition and address the worries of the assistant doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 fut@@ ures , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip @-@ post chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance physicians to termin@@ ate the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; struggle measures achieve nothing but little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant General and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries have responded positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ blowing . &quot;
&quot; the employers were hoping that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in regards to compl@@ ying with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart rate risk
&quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud in Muslim regions flour@@ ish
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption of a government report
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ les , former cabinet member , acc@@ esses the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of elec@@ tive abuse on account of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nie and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now a rebel king , said the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off barriers outside of bal@@ lot boxes to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a proof of their identity , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er simply needs to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person to apply if they vote their votes to prevent anyone choosing two times . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves for election fraud , but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ection Channel in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , portra@@ yed , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding le@@ dges to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Anglo @-@ American background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit mail@@ boxes to stop &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing two times .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes from local elections .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs around electoral stations .
a change of law which facilitates an accus@@ ation for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters go alone into the cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for corruption and illegal practices as un@@ suitable for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; of the vot@@ er registration departments of the town halls . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court judgment at Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are about the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , out of the border and band , who turned out to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only ath@@ lete looking for gold , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has made a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin brother of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks very similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the SA float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a hall@@ way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Drama
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alist Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; like a pig died
&quot; Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style floating staff@@ el of the C@@ BC @-@ Live@@ Transfer of the Ol@@ om@@ yp@@ h Games on Wednesday &quot;
&quot; the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; like low &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m share squ@@ ad@@ ron would give his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS board team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited , went off as low , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
audience in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200 free @-@ style squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with many of them talking to him . &quot;
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like Ras@@ si@@ sts . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; We are sorry that the comment on a swimming power was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people responding to the emer@@ gen@@ cies on Twitter &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in social media . &quot;
&quot; to make one clear , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC show , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
purch@@ as@@ ers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by Mrs. who sham@@ elessly tried in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman drew her clothing in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ ter@@ ned how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued rum@@ ma@@ ging and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the pri@@ mar@@ row shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before she laid it back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own sto@@ cking trousers and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like as they put them back into the shelf .
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing and went out and went out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who might under certain circumstances buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , living in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how in@@ war@@ dly to think someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and did not wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapon attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when one approaches you from behind , you should turn around as first so you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the gun , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the bar and twist , while the aggres@@ sor cur@@ bs in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it happened in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to over@@ ride your money , unless you are a Grand@@ master Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler subjected his immune system and worm ef@@ lex to a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing each object , he used a l@@ ur@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to check the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he y@@ um@@ bled , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to dish@@ washers , the task was defini@@ tively tested by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample @-@ line showed a lumin@@ osity value of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison with this , the lumin@@ osity value of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after her lumin@@ osity count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve ger@@ min@@ ed in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more pres@@ ump@@ tuous than that !
I will not lick here anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ date Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up telling us that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I instructed him to lick like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian on it , check them out and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they could at least use products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ung Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a deletion with a damage of £ 50,000 , because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had fl@@ aming holes , wooden boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ des and cur@@ es included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that is torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn down . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ oted her and her partner this week by force after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t sh@@ out for anyone . &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the final step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and had to be fear@@ ful for their neighbors .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gra@@ c@@ efully listened to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police took a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis as well as weighing , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial intent . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row , by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , announced that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to collaborate with partners in order to protect our communities .

&quot; also at the 3 : 2 in the pro@@ visi@@ oning against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know yet . &quot;

Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; thus the world rank@@ est first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam , &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and precisely Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ kul@@ ani .
&quot; as expected , the two Chinese made it into the final game and made the title one of them . &quot;
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympics Champion was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between the sentences and in time outs , they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had pulled back onto the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches , until here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequently . &quot;
after the game there were gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 year old opponent , Ma only had to fight in the first sentence . &quot;
&quot; after that he set the tempo on the plate , leaving Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
by the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the anticipated ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless sufficient breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ di@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White rus@@ se had suffered a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way a similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp hon@@ ors &quot; huge problems &quot; in the campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states , losing their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now revealed weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as little as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House now grow . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; Tru@@ mp said before evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt is false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ ot@@ ting . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ usa from June , Tru@@ mp and his con@@ cur@@ ator were based on the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he would stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if for him , at the end , for reasons of political correctness , it is okay , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp Party should have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better results . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans wanted to get stronger among the members of the Congress . &quot;
Olympia : triple dec@@ eit in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee dealt with promptly to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this has been reported to the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case , in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and acted as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal given and signed , &quot; &quot; declared Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan track delegation led Michael Rot@@ ich from Rio games . &quot;
he is to be informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing violations , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls launched by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , unusual athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
a number of ARD television reports have repeatedly raised alleg@@ ations that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
&quot; last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya about how he had hired her in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this type of sport was widespread and systematically mut@@ ed . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &apos;s artistic director wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria in this staging .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ ert@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were then . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
&quot; London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , died according to reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard of her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 17 , Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had expected to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people stop taking this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and , within a few months , became a widow . &quot;
&quot; Rei@@ d says , in the case of a victory victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge on Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later told that he had not spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats aims to Calendar for Women and Men
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked men , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine differs from old@@ school play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that the Calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting appeal in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts with mass flight
&quot; those who do not conform and Erdo@@ gan praise , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of asylum seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the associate president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with pen@@ alties for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are on the run in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the beaten put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which even receives refugees , produces refugees in its own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Association accused the targeted emig@@ ration of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in the Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or dispos@@ ed of in the past few hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the head of the Association demanded that the German government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers .
&quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in recent months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not conform and lo@@ be Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper under calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks , before the coup , reported the largest group of asylum seekers who were recognised because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this amounted to 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all were eligible to be eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there is no chance of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than so far , it &apos;s not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tive fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so you can &apos;t choose the land tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , ballo@@ ons infl@@ ate , fl@@ yers spread and counting on the end , only cum@@ ulative . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass just under the people for election campaign . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
exciting is how strong newcom@@ ers Af@@ D cut off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tional dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spreads ro@@ ses and talks a bit with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors get cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame for the flour@@ ishing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaign at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale projects twice ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag elections are in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , you have to put the base on the ground that it is very demanding to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are concerned like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast expan@@ ses of the country there is hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campaig@@ ner co@@ ca@@ ster to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where they w@@ eh@@ ave , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in recent poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the land tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and largely move their campaign against the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the president of the state Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go to search for local vocal ch@@ arities among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurbish@@ ment : restaurants suffering from blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work that will start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they made it pretty cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at half @-@ time at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; praise will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work , such as when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now return from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the journey through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King , responsible for the refurbish@@ ment of the refurbish@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner straße and Wei@@ her@@ land had to fight with more traffic noise because many paths looked for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality ampli@@ fied the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed himself on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour at the pace 30 .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 refurbish@@ ment has led to revenue out@@ breaks , everybody who asks is scrut@@ in@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; the running search is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the street .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers lack@@ ed H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , he insi@@ sts on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the street renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; back two years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he has to reti@@ re half of his collabor@@ ators .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbish@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much funding has been handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now visit less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly ro@@ uted in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , interior minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a corruption status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable for the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they overwhel@@ m no one .
&quot; other , further issues would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; as Minister of the Interior , however , he was based on results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck@@ down of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck down jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything , which is not a chance in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also presenting a few new ideas .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick @-@ action for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from deportation .
&quot; refugees , who are targeted specifically in the country , should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to face some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and judi@@ ci@@ ally delicate .
some of them are still un@@ exploited and leave questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; and things which the people deeply did , could not be compl@@ ained even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormously brid@@ ged .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went high . &quot;
&quot; only an armed conflict about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ policy idea @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the department leaders also demand a bur@@ ka prohibition and a departure from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also working here to reconci@@ le reconci@@ li@@ atory tones .
&quot; from a departure from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
it is not advisable to re@@ open it .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in there what could be done for arguments .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to gain a footh@@ old on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes a cau@@ tious willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhance security . &quot;
&quot; again , Volkswagen is getting off lightly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the ex@@ tradition figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action there is whi@@ r@@ l around a term .
Volkswagen enters the second half @-@ year with deliveries of deliveries .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car maker can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW brand was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus heavily loaded the sales of the company , just like the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year level . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on leaving the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ cat@@ er@@ ers first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony has got off lightly with the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is attributable to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales increase from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide to 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW invites around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car owner made a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
the reason for this is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all type approval relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , it is important to secure uncertainty as to possible warran@@ ties as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal austerity measures would not have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is asking for private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he be@@ ware of 40 million euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now higher . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash simply lie in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and change to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry them alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their skat@@ eboard branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay flat @-@ cover charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little rich in wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if it be@@ ware for free money . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to compete . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not like this in their width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section to over@@ look it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ity &quot; &quot; of men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the repeated resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who bought a record recently are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older turn@@ tables tend to retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ d@@ ded before I stop , hold my hands and tell something more like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I received from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are causing them to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I conducted , people usually emp@@ tied their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record company of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record shops offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received an impetus from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to reti@@ re to the stability of familiar sound plate envel@@ opes , of items that evoke bli@@ ss@@ ful feelings of joy . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ ps from a stack of records . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet joined them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just recently came here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only come back slowly . &quot;
&quot; mo@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans out of the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but some psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale . &quot;
it is more of a window @-@ bum@@ per than a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting plates is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to mu@@ le the jeans pockets , I watch a group of young teen girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras , before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that most stands out for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , leave the large number of female collectors living in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are likely to work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they ste@@ er the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er , who rises above the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court refuses offer about demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores where people within the bearing sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is widely operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;s Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the Olympic period , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin does not want to get lost . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he needed to analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time @-@ run World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed over the last time .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who had lost 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

watching video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am that special@@ ises in this hobby .
&quot; as much money flows for the acquisition , Microsoft did not share it on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January , and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard game starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help . &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .

Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the market for video games live streaming is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are tested , which are intended to transfer tem@@ pos@@ culp@@ tures very effectively . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary Tem@@ plates there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a steady speed limit for compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days at an un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans by time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer coupling according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also slip @-@ proof outer cover disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold reco@@ vers
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ day Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday night , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ ed Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , post @-@ back , line circulation and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Games of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad value of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not be - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderfully and let the attacks burst out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co . , as if you run in driving buses . the World Series Win@@ ner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au stre@@ amed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a hat@@ eful T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still un@@ learned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; UK introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova to a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , p@@ anning and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked crus@@ hing in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown pushed the bu@@ cks forward in the first half but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the two sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she recru@@ ited to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax conc@@ ub@@ ine , the first women in the history of British sport which made such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unused engagement , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al figure . &quot;
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the trainer who didn &apos;t know if he would survive this day even when he was diagnosed with cancer .
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads out everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ star@@ ing morning with something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I have done , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not anxious to do something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity provided
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the purpose association .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was much more than exemplary in Bavaria .
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the ken@@ nel association , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually supports around 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current Chairman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and initiation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the flood reser@@ vo@@ irs ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renovation of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still and I have always received new additions , because water &apos;s life and drinking water are the most important means of food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived out of the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia Water Forum . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the one hand , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of the well as well as the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high @-@ pressure vessel near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn , too , could only be maintained because one filled the hop@@ per of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and killed them deadly .
&quot; the man himself called to us and stated to have shot his companion in life , &quot; a police spokes@@ woman said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be travelling with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. will call 110 .
the police talk about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lü@@ beck , at first , did not want to make any information about the di@@ pping or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens created by the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion in existing plants for the so @-@ called intrin@@ sic electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , had initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading segment , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel sector in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a substantial price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensified more than the world &apos;s largest producer of producers in China faced massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import @-@ steel effects , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have subsi@@ ded . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price @-@ recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated sooner . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the steel business shared on Friday . &quot;
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May the crowd went back for the second month in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association anticip@@ ates a rising output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is doing good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in teacher studies she finished the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people .
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors have a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand their lungs do not get too fast out of the box in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in older generations , joint singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and particularly melodies , even people with dementia medit@@ ate on long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; while singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on one &apos;s voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially elderly , who live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; show yourself : if I do something for a long time , I will grow better and grow over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears when a tone goes beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats respond more sensi@@ tively than cats to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ ut@@ ations of cat babies have on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mus@@ her did not leave the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys on the mi@@ ch@@ ew of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great distress , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary College and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ties of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers believe their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when this calls off the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be wor@@ sen@@ ed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to babies , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before Du@@ eling the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even when the emergency was suspended after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
there is no stop in front of football .
&quot; against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , Sü@@ k@@ ür is accused of being a member of a terrorist group now living in America . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ ür should be the suppor@@ ter of the minister Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held ac@@ coun@@ table by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency lasted for 90 days , it is still valid until October . in fact , this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan declared the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the president .
&quot; what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky is going to arrive especially again . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Cologne presented its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record player found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the preliminary K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; say good @-@ bye to the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g , it reached only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky said . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year went better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season numbers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return to the country after its European holiday due to the political situation in the country . &quot;
&quot; if Mario , however , wants to come to us , he must just say , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot;
&quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ unce about a third of its value estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing lock had su@@ ed her starting right just before the games , was plu@@ gged off mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it offered herself a bizarre scene : with a s@@ miles on her face , she was still walking in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was established that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush tower . &quot;
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing @-@ past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already closed for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been certified by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had heavy tooth ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic champion in 2012 and European champion had a positive effect on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine in 2011 and 2016 .
&quot; Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing , and was closed for six months . &quot;
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion about 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , moist@@ ened Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ lete , so many med@@ als were subsequently recognized . &quot;
T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having been diagnosed with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
&quot; in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympia silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 for testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized by the 2008 Olympic Games , was awarded to the CA@@ S International Sports Court . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio anyway . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Championships , references to taking a banned food supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ shell error in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left this hospital again . &quot;
she planned her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; two explo@@ sives went up again on Friday morning , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ated near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives set off in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ ony on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ ori@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to manifest themselves to possible motives , but probably the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received secret po@@ inters to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; it is still unclear , which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not address tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to destroy chaos , while the country in the direction of stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members himself to have led the Kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok they were killed in a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; identity @-@ free movement &quot; has come into the sight of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional safegu@@ ards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ sturb@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ sturb@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identical movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; extre@@ mi@@ sts in general are trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a commercial advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , reports about contacts from the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been reported from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the protection of the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such persons have control over the party . &quot;
this is not apparent .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ eating said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be legally @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other judicial groups or small groups are forming , which plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee streams or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of rights terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the existing groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspect &apos;s attacks on asylum accommodation had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records cannot always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia become so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently used for viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his course with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
&quot; since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; was funny with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style , didn &apos;t play any role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not see the threat of election so closely
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there &apos;s nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very beautiful , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with U.S. TV sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him to make political correctness for him at the end , he said , &quot; Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the Can@@ did@@ acy of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric feed vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
&quot; shortly , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the post office intends to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they will ship their self @-@ developed cluster sco@@ oter with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ ard had said that there will always be inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; after information from the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production fabrication , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ber announced that the group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars , and in the long term p@@ onder@@ ed a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP guided tour ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the de@@ pu@@ ties suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K market research company had gu@@ essed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate governance is the world &apos;s number five in front of a personnel new start .
&quot; at the end of the year , the GF@@ RP Executive Board will leave the company . &quot;
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the Management Board will take over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; who will be leading the market research company in future , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K head since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; given the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , we would do the Qu@@ and@@ ts as well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company had not been able to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros fell by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were neg@@ atively affected by its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the Group sales volume of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , contributed to the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in cru@@ mbs in tren@@ ches : eight wounded
&quot; during an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors and passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( Aur@@ ich Land@@ kreis ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her information according to an opposite vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ train . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people were not able to leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a transit bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the load veter@@ ans and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a clou@@ dy calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was approved by the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ effective basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as manager of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt pointed out the board , a re @-@ calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ coverings from the previous calculation period may also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt substanti@@ ated the grave increase in fees , making it possible for all three wastewater facilities to handle relatively small facilities with a very low sewage treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , during the rec@@ umbent calculation period in all three plants , rehabilitation and repair expenses were not least due to a considerable amount due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the H@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of damage .
&quot; in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken from the ground and at the L@@ opp pond , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge is dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be maintained in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were substantially below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully exploited at the low sewage treatment in the three plants .
&quot; as a result , Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed for the waste water facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser &apos;s view , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious as one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer system in order to expand these facilities because it is a lack of sanitary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in advance for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , stand@@ alone tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all wrong entran@@ ces arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn cri@@ tique in the past where they were accused of the fact that the app would promote black@@ face promotion or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and so@@ aked che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es were on a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to be an homage to anim@@ e characters rather than car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others opted for the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ k@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and in@@ convenient . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was dra@@ gged into the descending extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride dragon .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more diverse in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that fast @-@ based controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the sett@@ ling practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man the company recently hired a personnel responsible focused on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she will be closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of the Congress &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed to report in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Defence , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the Ar@@ ms budget , reports on major dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence reports , which were typically picked up by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly marked a positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed ongoing issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play out the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into their lives after being played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , and the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; issued the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaging the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave over@@ ly little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ e to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was received after complaints from Cent@@ Com . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these key issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the critics concerning the secret information about the Islamic State are reminiscent of other than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush did not fores@@ ee a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , according to government agencies , Mr. Hoo@@ ker reported that , contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
&quot; the US won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey for women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the Brit@@ ons , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each . &quot;
the first placed one will go a bit longer by the strong Dutch lady who will lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game ends on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey club in his hands for the first time in three years ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ am the helm completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back cover from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament , but the team showed themselves surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistently and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the tri@@ ath@@ lete from the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been under these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been so ridi@@ cul@@ ously noticed the last 16 years that many people I inter@@ viewed did not know that it is even an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who has made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has some exterior char@@ ms , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a low@@ n@@ s@@ School than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , meaning &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising jum@@ pers jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram of execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they are not only ch@@ asing the finish line or the output wall , but also a further increase in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic car . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed while watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up again . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is just as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ang@@ ling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently proposed , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to be drunk . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political change in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia currently working together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but during the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shooting and killing hundreds of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereas dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous ail@@ ments covering everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which in recent years have been more or less forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of hiding under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they had gathered in such protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the information provided by analysts , were apparently denied by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; developing experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ fortun@@ es of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist town , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the tig@@ ray is more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the base for d@@ ron@@ ding flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw up new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and easily with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful period , to explain in the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the announcement during an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp rec@@ alled the statement on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , in which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp attempted to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive and if necessary , &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction goes out . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even more estimated tone , as his cargo values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a large margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp has generally tried to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sk@@ imm@@ ed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people smoked it as the last loss in a genetically modified town .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel Exclu@@ ded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is also a new invention . &quot;
&quot; a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not anticipate any gru@@ dge that the soap business has taken the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ shop would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favourites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Til@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the United States , while bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , straightforward snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh @-@ cheese sandwich with olive slices , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut @-@ bread , liver cheese and bean @-@ bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a bit cheaper to put the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country moved with it , not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic in the food for the Americans , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new idea was just as ten@@ se as the new budget : mysterious food , such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es , became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , since coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
strange bl@@ ends have been tried since a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zes flavor or even healthy cooking .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lun@@ ches , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - set the country &apos;s eating habits in such a way . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
&quot; particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers &apos; kitchen of his kitchen , he was the million@@ aire man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in a nearly gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was amaz@@ ingly realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt led to the fact that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the decay of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the dessert recipe , the president Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give humble recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon into the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed homes and to help in the war area first aid . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a mam@@ mal from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said lou@@ dly : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing difficulties .
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest vor@@ tex is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland h@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ h@@ ie only got young children with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 metres far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal speeds up to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; according to the evolutionary bi@@ ologist , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist soon assumed that Greenland h@@ arks will be st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland h@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland h@@ arks .
&quot; their slow motion , they measured six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; the loo@@ t nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may ch@@ ase dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and search for cad@@ a@@ vers , which are tor@@ tured from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear dis@@ ar@@ ming attempts have prevented large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all major Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens core , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k female only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this may also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ yl@@ al@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest in a long life . &quot;
building plot in double pack
&quot; with topics relating to construction , the municipal council has focused primarily on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Panel received the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported living areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is no longer available for interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community attrac@@ tively attract young families and former sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , building will@@ s can report from now on in the town hall , by awar@@ ding the par@@ c@@ els the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to request further en@@ quiries about sett@@ ling further commercial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the re @-@ created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial transactions will continue to operate from London to financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval has been enough for them in the UK so far . &quot;
they are using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but just as it deterior@@ ates in the infrastructure of the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Merc@@ er Corporate Consulting , the city is on seventh place in Luxembourg , in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W refuses . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers . &quot;
&quot; the balance of forces also speaks for this : in the end of 2015 , according to figures by the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge exposed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. secretary of Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alise with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the US have conquered full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently fighting the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just carry out cleaning work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published its tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated a USD 3 million in@@ comes from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine of Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective 20.@@ 3 % federal tax rate in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers expressed a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; critics , among other things the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , its donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business units and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown herself on the issue and on Friday published a video on the Internet , asking Tru@@ mp Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to publish his tax declaration . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; politicians reported that during the 1990s Tru@@ mp paid no or very little taxes , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax advis@@ ors and tax consultants on Friday that could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic . &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here to exchange Tru@@ mp a meeting to meet their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to an I@@ RS tax test and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 Clinton &apos;s tax declaration showed that it was only USD 100 of its income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ te and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ffs .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion together with US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many spec@@ ers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the World Bank Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with the earth , the mixture is mixed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is twisted to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ffs into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last option is a ship@@ pers who shoots a gold blast furnace into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; however , the municipal council now rejected the proposal for the new construction of a sales ski on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ on in the building . &quot;

Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election as it requested Arab guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sho@@ wer@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management .
the reason behind this was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ den @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some of them were subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged demands of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement &quot; to not include Israel in the fast electoral list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police destro@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police attacked Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police rub@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president of Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador stated . &quot;
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
it noted that the trading turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade uprising was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Office issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , first and foremost travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as far as the number of tourists in Russia concerned . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market covered in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the provision of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had per@@ ver@@ ted their faces , demanded the release of cash by the employee of the Be@@ verage Consu@@ l and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking area of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escape from the gravel parking lot located opposite the park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the Tat@@ too ( at 19.@@ 45 pm ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should report urgently to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during the summer time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet place of Lei@@ theim , the life @-@ loving group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to board with the visit of the string zoo .
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days the group rejo@@ iced at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; kids and car@@ ers with their self prepared cour@@ tiz@@ ers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were culinary . &quot;
&quot; workshops were b@@ ati@@ fied , creating beautiful pieces of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all ministers in the course of two years , the top ranking of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of Am@@ bru@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the congregation , arose in the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was assigned . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a rest for Feld@@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
parish priests of the local parish were at their disposal for the overnight stays .
&quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty , tasty dinner and breakfast at the destinations . &quot;
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on the other hand , the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , had to fall off at first some 500 metres in altitude , and then again climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and crossed the doors of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; in the evening Mass in Münster , the min@@ is received at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by the co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
after the divine service the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the party was proud when he stor@@ med home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie staff .
they did this in time as outward appearance .
he &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic Ch@@ ord in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , Hin@@ der lay almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went into a higher gear , to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that he was deliberately falling on the track after a weak start . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
Hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bike bro@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the Form Kenn@@ ys it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic med@@ als in a competition .
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; world record , who won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is rel@@ ying on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a tro@@ ar of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly remarkable representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; they played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and bul@@ b@@ bin tut@@ ors as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby increasing all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a maximinum payout of 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could end@@ anger at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting mill with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three additional owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through enam@@ elling , &quot; the company announced . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of enam@@ el &quot; does not dimin@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts caution due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity every year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of Cover@@ s was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family similar ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases and producers of keeping up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ ause ) , as they miss the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action of almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ause brought the sentence &quot; &quot; You thought that we should have forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to somehow let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of karma has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her , what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more than a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still leak before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ urn &quot; as &quot; Models , are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youth of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true of J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not every one . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings were boiling up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but getting around on the ab@@ norm@@ ality seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; city center centers annually assign 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are rejected annually by the municipalities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already extensively utilized , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centre of Fri@@ esland , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Uni@@ fication of Communities Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the cancellation of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp El@@ ection Camp@@ a@@ ign For Emplo@@ ye@@ es supposedly We@@ ap@@ ing We@@ ap@@ ons
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , when she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina did a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i claimed to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right finger on the trigger , and grab@@ bed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ ying with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People - S@@ uss@@ ars and arms friends - should take action if his rival powers H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges . &quot;
&quot; the campaign clearly stated that the media had torn its words out of the context , and that it would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of due diligence and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are marked for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling party . &quot;
&quot; this gave representative opinion poll@@ s by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances of continuing with the head of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party just blows just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 3 per cent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , according to the poll@@ s in Berlin , the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 23.@@ 4 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; at 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens remained behind the Gre@@ ens ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that the pir@@ ates would miss in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even via fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile sp@@ line experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market ma@@ stered providers who all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; being online always and everywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smart phones worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices were sold , while Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies come to this end .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success started , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; finally , she disappeared , Black@@ berry tried to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in average , every German now watches his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we will provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
&quot; the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 , and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of wit@@ ch@@ craft growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who implemented a £ 11 billion in infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is backed by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempt to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it was reported that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect what part of the page advertisement is adverti@@ sed . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and forth battle between the anti @-@ time open source community and the b@@ yp@@ asses has been in progress since the invention of indicating lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how wor@@ rying adverti@@ sers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display blo@@ wers all over the world ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared . &quot;
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a big share of revenue so Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest in such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; a spokes@@ man of Facebook announced in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we instead focus on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a highway in a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , calling on these and any witnesses of the incident to report themselves . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark ran on the highway , it was decided that the drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as was said in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Cli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a rain@@ bow to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution , which had previously been suspected by planetary researchers . &quot;
&quot; although probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ad@@ al Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately search for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick kept me informed today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was honored as the best coach of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the night season . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches noted in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ eed oil workers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the work struggles concerning wages for North @-@ sea workers are suspended , while all the dispute parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the United Nations and R@@ MT trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company provide the required space in order to get through the market crash .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had intensified by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest working disputes which took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and all over the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;

the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , and in which connection the rotation periods are associated with the planetary creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star @-@ loops , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a press release . &quot;
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster of stars , created about 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
&quot; to top @-@ rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars run large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest range of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars revol@@ ving slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why Stars will slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez made a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be included in the bas@@ eb@@ alls of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so disputed his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a winding in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ at@@ y . &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends were once again the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was told , sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ec@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive ath@@ lete would almost have won a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ prec@@ ursor in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ec@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical hit Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated , which is used as a mass@@ aging agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the performances of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , he applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of the sports@@ men with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal a@@ woke from Dan@@ ec@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot;
according to the report it is said that the banned substance must be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
&quot; Dan@@ ec@@ ova was suspended tent@@ atively , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , approximately all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ poll@@ uted nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abo@@ lic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both of them do the same , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , especially the Dan@@ ec@@ owa fall is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the launch , even the du@@ sts of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China had also taken care of the athletes . &quot;
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over to it , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the centre of an examination with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 enterprises in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; 40 percent of the victims paid willingly the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for ex@@ tor@@ ting ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sho@@ cking quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim active , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ Logic Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the companies affected by German companies reported turnover losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acute acute by the loss of acute illnesses . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of down@@ time in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the us@@ efulness @-@ areas and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators really try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to negotiate partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their malware even in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware kits have been created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ ser then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is per in@@ explic@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals engage sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators rather thre@@ aten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference &quot; &quot; Def@@ con &quot; , &quot; safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat integrated with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top falls down somewhat . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V for storage .
&quot; there is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l in case of back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ cop@@ es and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded very well , but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , do something qui@@ eter in his work . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the safety system belongs to the City emergency braking assistant ( operates at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assist system . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
&quot; however , full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much , will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in case of haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a cra@@ b during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it &apos;s a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer pay
&quot; after their journey , people with ill rest will only get money back if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment plant , which allegedly had poll@@ uted sea water . &quot;
the family thought that the trip had been faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizer was only informed shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea water was fine .
&quot; he has therefore not viol@@ ated his duty of information , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disorder of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be pru@@ dent and at the same time react to terrorist risks .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if a perpetr@@ ator would have to leave the country faster , this hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the election of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ length scale order over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce can be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should be kept in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhance security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly concerning action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of double nationality previously .
it is un@@ constitutional if a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problemati@@ cal .
you cannot prohi@@ bit everything you are rej@@ ecting and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the Minister of simul@@ ating action and action with new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people no longer security in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right to the right of law shall be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for all cars , drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient street every night when they travel across the free@@ way to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is increasing early , which improves overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the spine reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is guided only one lane through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt more than three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy load traffic in two lanes . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ to @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the responsible state @-@ owned company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years have to be expected : because the bridge has an official remaining period of remaining until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during school holidays , because with disabilities it is to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural activities for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatres are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s haus School has a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; initiated by the society of N@@ ima , 19 students from eleven to 15 years attended the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the students of the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are included in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ p gu@@ ck@@ sters in the southwest of Germany on Friday a das@@ h through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky &apos;s spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many con@@ stell@@ ations in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ ring @-@ ring@@ ing no more to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
what are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , member of the board of the German Society of S@@ itting and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one sees in the pro@@ vision@@ ally is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and sleep @-@ disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the sleeping experience many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxon Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another illness .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I check with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; for those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advises we@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ worn , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleeping specialist in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , advises we@@ ft . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , in case of abnormal daily fatigue , sleeping conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze says . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not make no@@ on@@ ful sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is drawing on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep .
&quot; we@@ ft counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not sleeping too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and not at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler comments on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing down@@ cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first scored gold in the short @-@ way world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € should nobody wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the pumping system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who now runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ des taken from baggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the Tat@@ ars had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ pil@@ es as ban@@ des .
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from previous th@@ ef@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July , and they were very professional , professional and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the criminal commission@@ er 34 can prove to the thi@@ eves , who had entered Germany especially for the purpose of comm@@ itting crimes to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between are a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like that , but the police are among the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from the east to the west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly renovated kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; jump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new lease flats are to be built . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have ten@@ ants , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner @-@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has had several times advoc@@ ated for a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ater@@ mi@@ ths , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ gated official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the buildings renovated the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se before the latter . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who raised three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ asing on the left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between the occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ators from all over the world in recent years : now residents of East Germany and former domestic occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at the raised pan@@ es or freshly painted facades that were thrown with pig@@ ments .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make damage to property , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant house beside the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved to Riga &apos;s streets .
&quot; that is why it was so important for her to get back to the streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly stressed the district authority over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building blocks , which the old residents impose . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well dispos@@ ed of are living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the neighbourhood . &quot;
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district and can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked to not be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee responsible for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ less but rather targeted on the variety of tasks requested - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supported hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Office Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been a very difficult task for some time now .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be intim@@ i@@ dating as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wo@@ ken up or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , work does not only mean labour . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so it requires offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so here too administration and honorary officials are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problems , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all that is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed . &quot;
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the assass@@ ins had them completely ob@@ itu@@ ated .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore main and honorary officials must look for activities on site and in the region .
they have always been in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , one needs to help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lar@@ s were looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the occup@@ ant surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , carrying both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; for clu@@ es , the police had several strips of strike as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the F@@ ahn@@ dung was without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell near the apartment or during their escape . &quot;
