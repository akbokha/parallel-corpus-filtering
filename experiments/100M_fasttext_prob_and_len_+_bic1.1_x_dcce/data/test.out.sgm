<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted back home to the fodder in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the complex of ALRV, on a horse he didn't even spill himself for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for a long time, the first time in Aachen and with it also with the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sporting event was handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala of the Golden Athlete Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of distinctions to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Lorrel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th Winner of the pyramid of Sports is a long one.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talents for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as well."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was included in the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider of Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warn of how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will make a massive return on regulations, and he will be strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money for it. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the government-critical issue of the Republican Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be even party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and repress coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement intends to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, with its investment program, Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy and claim:" a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both however, both want to isolate the US from international trade, rather than simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rend, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump stands, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out to him that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fled woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is staring at the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social aid programmes in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs visited the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope-makers," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh the other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, moral murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs ask for a bottle of water a sexual act, is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not develop voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, it requires more accommodation for them only, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for receiving refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich, some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is included in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection, can be read by the crowd who gives it to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance physicians argue: demands for new employment campaigns</seg>
<seg id="2">Deputy Prime Ministers have called on their union to approve new employment policies in their dispute regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more employment policies from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have smuggled to deal with the concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solicit official renegotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating employment campaigns starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians were struck by six times this year, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the BMA Assistant Doctor, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he informed BMA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced forcibly."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands, and to announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be very palpable, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state forgot nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin wiped out and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"building up the uncle is difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media had a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, primarily, needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecasts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"for this purpose, the continuing grudge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an analyst, an" Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that were driven away from the West and badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they would not even have touched the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was Vice President of Ivanovo since 2012, was named his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in the Estonian Capital of Tallinn, he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV broadcaster that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino, as his successor, recommended."</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin and working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the general elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man, who once was touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complain posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian president for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people to whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, closest ally coup, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president again three and a half years later."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" ceiling blower, "which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all the witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridgedeck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, nearly 79% of the total decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the shutter is forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"following the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the shore."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct has a length of 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"uncles, because the tolerances on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they only ruined a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the future, the SPD and the Greens think: investors should be taken much more seriously in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "action concept for living" "at the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But arguments are programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann points out:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas has to point out 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favourable dwellings can also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, as viola:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing support programme, which will cost millions of dollars and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann says:" "there is no agreement between the factions right now."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to set investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as viola, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is velled."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is still not entirely: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one look like the loss of more than 1300 low-priced apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning politician Nicole Palm, should now buy out-going bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to return apartments back to price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West City.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, the year-end dates expire."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West City is increased drastically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said Group president Holger Herlitschke comments:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go by boat."</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside but rather prefer spending their free time, staring on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially restricted to TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for videogames in the 1990s (later it created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and once found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" taken prisoner. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average" "average" "person sets back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "30 minutes" "to come" "from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "hit deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are playthings that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be refilled over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked off on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallists Aliya Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while she reinforces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has the last three years of her sport dominated, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue one said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not accidental.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her end-to-face - pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book, became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team capitaine, who is called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her floor exercise she threw down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks from Phoenix ever since they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," shared Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990ies, a black BMW from the late 1990ies and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I propose to myself under the Women's Olympics in the Gymnastics Federation and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, completes, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won Gold at an individual multicamp event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but it does not look like gymnastics throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have four female turners in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns are an expensive sport and gymnastics primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, alignment, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner receive their entire training and that is for families an expensive and long-term commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities out innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easily accessible gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the holen of the Olympic team and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption of a government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Picles, former cabinet member, accesses the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of elective abuse on account of" "hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now a rebel king, said the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off barriers outside of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a proof of their identity, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter simply needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests, not removable ink on the finger of a person to apply if they vote their votes to prevent anyone choosing two times."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves for election fraud, but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election Channel in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobic allegations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person elects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmingly to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, portrayed, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding ledges to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or Anglo-American background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behavior on the basis of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit mailboxes to stop" "election harvest". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing two times.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit full mailings and envelopes from local elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up lockouts around electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law which facilitates an accusation for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on photographing in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters go alone into the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for corruption and illegal practices as unsuitable for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check-ups" "of the voter registration departments of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court judgment at Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spreading of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"to worsen the situation, she patterned how she looked at it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued rummaging and rehearsed four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the primarrow shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tasted the underpants before she laid it back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear she went back and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own stocking trousers and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">Everyone stared when they pulled out the underpants that you obviously did not like as they put them back into the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three other underpants before she finally decided that she liked nothing and went out and went out.</seg>

<seg id="15">"Mrs Davidson added:" "as I have received, the employees have tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had touched her and did not wash her.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt for a guide his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler subjected his immune system and worm eflex to a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a banister on Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing each object, he used a lurometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to light."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to check the rinsing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he yumbled, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to dishwashers, the task was definitively tested by the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample-line showed a luminosity value of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison with this, the luminosity value of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after her luminosity count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That's the worst thing I've germined in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more presumptuous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here anything here because it is disgusting here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validate Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy brainstorming that ended up telling us that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I instructed him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian on it, check them out and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they could at least use products that included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asoziale family left their social apartment after a deletion with a damage of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had flaming holes, wooden boards were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strides and cures included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house that is torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn down."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delooted her and her partner this week by force after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogivings were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't shout for anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogiation is always the final step to consider Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and had to be fearful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have gracefully listened to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloculation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police took a raid in the house and took over 70g cannabis as well as weighing, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skeldon received a fine, after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial intent."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 during a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will delve tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow, by the police of Devon and Cornwall, announced that delogification is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach and those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to collaborate with partners in order to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who do not conform and Erdogan praise, sit on packed suitcases," "says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish municipality of Germany anticipates tens of thousands of asylum seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany at short notice.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" "some hundred thousand", "the associate president Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already covered Kurdish high-bursts with penalties for months, 500,000 Kurds are on the run in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the beaten putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state, which even receives refugees, produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the Association accused the targeted emigration of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in the Algerian cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan wants to raise the pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or disposed of in the past few hundred years," Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the Association demanded that the German government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, there is a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for the first time in recent months, I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as Gülen trailers destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"those who do not conform and lobe Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialog and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the newspaper under calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Turks, before the coup, reported the largest group of asylum seekers who were recognised because of political persecution."</seg>
<seg id="22">"as of June 30, this amounted to 11.386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all were eligible to be eligible for asylum (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more than so far, it's not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the elective fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so you can't choose the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays helpers, the posters hang up, balloons inflate, flyers spread and counting on the end, only cumulative."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass just under the people for election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomers AfD cut off and what remains at the end of coalitional dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, spreads roses and talks a bit with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors get cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame for the flourishing of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" We create "have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will now cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaign at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale projects twice; Merkel's Bundestag elections are in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, according to Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country, you have to put the base on the ground that it is very demanding to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are concerned like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vast expanses of the country there is hardly any."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral campaigner cocaster to his comrades is also self-exposing:" they must go where they wehave, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in recent polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and largely move their campaign against the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign", "it calls the president of the state Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners go to search for local vocal charities among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffering from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work that will start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m., there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made it pretty crunchy," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"praise will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work, such as when it comes to setting up accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The journey through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," "says the deputy head manager Florian King, responsible for the refurbishment of the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafner straße and Weiherland had to fight with more traffic noise because many paths looked for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality amplified the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "says King, who made himself informed himself on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour at the pace 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue outbreaks, everybody who asks is scrutinised."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Thomas Sulz also talks about a" "maximum slight decline" "at the dealership Maier, but also admits that, of course," the running search is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers lacked Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in terms of sales revenue, he insists on" far more than 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the street renovation took its operation" "back two years". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to retire half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now, they must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other counties, where so much funding has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"finally, the family business has been here since 1715, referring to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now visit less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the renovation works, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, which is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly routed in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, interior minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the sergeant.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically reasonable for the coalition partner," "says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package."</seg>
<seg id="7">They overwhelm no one.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further issues would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as Minister of the Interior, however, he was based on results and at a" achievable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things have already been announced, announced, announced, that a new security authority should take care of the crackdown of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second attempt on proposals that were not to be done with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock down jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, he still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything, which is not a chance in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière is also presenting a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans quick-action for deportations and more possibilities for detecting people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, who are targeted specifically in the country, should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to face some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and judicially delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unexploited and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things which the people deeply did, could not be complained even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormously bridged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, the two parties went high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only an armed conflict about the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security-policy idea-collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the department leaders also demand a burka prohibition and a departure from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also working here to reconcile reconciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a departure from the double pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not advisable to reopen it.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in case of a burka ban he has constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is" reasonable "for the coalition partner, must first show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot in there what could be done for arguments.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is currently trying to gain a foothold on the subject of internal security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section to overlook it under the pseudonym" "Non-Alleenity" "of men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the repeated resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought a record recently are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older turntables tend to retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly studded before I stop, hold my hands and tell something more like:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are causing them to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I conducted, people usually emptied their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record company of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received an impetus from the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar sound plate envelopes, of items that evoke blissful feelings of joy."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flips from a stack of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet joined them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only come back slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"mop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz moans out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but some psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-bumper than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a dearded sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to mule the jeans pockets, I watch a group of young teen girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that most stands out for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they, at least in record stores in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors living in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are likely to work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they steer the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter, who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores where people within the bearing sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely understandable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is widely operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids's Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Britain at the 7-day Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis in the final on Thursday night, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deed Stadium."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though there were only the two sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she recruited to the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax concubine, the first women in the history of British sport which made such a benchmark."</seg>

<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal figure."</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the trainer who didn't know if he would survive this day even when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, he spreads out everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not anxious to do something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens created by the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion in existing plants for the so-called intrinsic electricity production in the German steel industry," said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition). "</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, had initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said to the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, all an EEG levy of 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" "steel is future" "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions trading segment, climate and employment targets are weighed down," "said IG Metall-chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel sector in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a substantial price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation intensified more than the world's largest producer of producers in China faced massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import-steel effects, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have subsided."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price-recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated sooner."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the end, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 8,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the steel business shared on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May the crowd went back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is doing good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teacher studies she finished the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German seniors division."</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors have a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get too fast out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in older generations, joint singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and particularly melodies, even people with dementia meditate on long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on one's voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly, who live alone, do not only concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"show yourself: if I do something for a long time, I will grow better and grow over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="18">"it is too early to manifest themselves to possible motives, but probably the acts of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military junta.</seg>

<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, changes their target direction and becomes extremist."</seg>

<seg id="22">This is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maeating said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>

<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records cannot always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia become so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently used for viral Internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old completed his course with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but it was rather his not just athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media."</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"referring to a" "prosperity belly" "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "was funny with" "Dad Bod". ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn't play any role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000, the run by Eric Moussambani ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater amount to 2.10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl, 3.44 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to now 2.18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a cloudy calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic metre."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget, Kulmbach was approved by the Federal Council of Agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems at a cost-effective basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as manager of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt pointed out the board, a re-calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercoverings from the previous calculation period may also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt substantiated the grave increase in fees, making it possible for all three wastewater facilities to handle relatively small facilities with a very low sewage treatment, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, during the recumbent calculation period in all three plants, rehabilitation and repair expenses were not least due to a considerable amount due to their age."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for the Hahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that in the sewage plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from the ground and at the Lopp pond, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge is disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be maintained in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses came to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were substantially below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully exploited at the low sewage treatment in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, Schmidt, the market town of large entertainment costs remained spared for the waste water facilities over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to Steinhäuser's view, the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious as one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewer system in order to expand these facilities because it is a lack of sanitary facilities."</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, standalone tools that produce more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All wrong entrances arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn critique in the past where they were accused of the fact that the app would promote blackface promotion or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and soaked cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies were on a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was intended to be an homage to anime characters rather than caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others opted for the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparkani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos that the filter was" hurtful and inconvenient. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was dragged into the descending extremity."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride dragon.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to erase her Snapchat account and to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that fast-based controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the settling practices in Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu also criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman the company recently hired a personnel responsible focused on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu, in turn, said that she will be closed her Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, establishes Committee of the Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Defence, Intelligence Committees and the Arms budget, reports on major discontent among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence reports, which were typically picked up by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly marked a positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed ongoing issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play out the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after being played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, and the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an overly restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," issued the highest-level democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaging the morals among analysts and" gave overly little space for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no clue to an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analyst with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was received after complaints from CentCom."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these key issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the critics concerning the secret information about the Islamic State are reminiscent of other than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush did not foresee a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, according to government agencies, Mr. Hooker reported that, contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the US won fourth match in the field hockey for women, a showdown with Great Britain"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember it ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the Britons, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed one will go a bit longer by the strong Dutch lady who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey club in his hands for the first time in three years (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to roam the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back cover from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed themselves surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we're in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistently and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the triathlete from the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been under these well-known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being TV commercials, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so ridiculously noticed the last 16 years that many people I interviewed did not know that it is even an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who has made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has some exterior charms, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a lownsSchool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, meaning" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising jumpers jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to the official Olympiaprogram of execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallists need to go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they are not only chasing the finish line or the output wall, but also a further increase in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic car."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to be drunk."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia currently working together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereas dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options other than protesting, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments covering everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which in recent years have been more or less forced to use turmoil and rearm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hiding under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they had gathered in such protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, which are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a upheaval was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the information provided by analysts, were apparently denied by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"developing experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misfortunes of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersist town, run by Tigray and the hatred of the tigray is more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the base for dronding flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw up new questions about the communication skills of the Republican Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and easily with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take protection during an eventful period, to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the announcement during an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalled the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained" "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive and if necessary," "clarify" "according to how the reaction goes out." "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more estimated tone, as his cargo values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a large margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump has generally tried to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocally his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind-brokers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread it aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, miserable" TV experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new cafe."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Tilman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last book" Chop Suey "acted from Chinese cuisine in the United States, while brickman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest co-operation," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brickman, 54, ordered a fresh-cheese sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter ordered hackers, this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut-bread, liver cheese and bean-bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a bit cheaper to put the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways in which the country moved with it, not to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when Americans became a central, tense topic in the food for the Americans," "Coe asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new idea was just as tense as the new budget: mysterious food, such as breads and casseroles, became staple food, the casserolle as a" wonderful way to recycle food leftovers, "Brickman noted, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange blends have been tried since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction prioritizes flavor or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunches," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions don't fit together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vortex is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland harks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhie only got young children with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 metres far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal speeds up to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the evolutionary biologist, the evolutionary biologist soon assumed that Greenland harks will be stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland harks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland harks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion, they measured six animals with a transmitter before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the loot nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may chase dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and search for cadavers, which are tortured from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear disarming attempts have prevented large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all major Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark female only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methylales live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-whale, in whose speck on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy at the Freiburg cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Ambruelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the congregation, arose in the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and distributed the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was assigned."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writing texts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the party was proud when he stormed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as outward appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">He's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner made an Olympic Chord in the Qualification Round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first lap."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, Hinder lay almost back, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went into a higher gear, to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hinder admitted that he was deliberately falling on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">Hinder said: "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bike broodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form Kennys it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny, who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"world record, who won gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a troar of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly remarkable representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"they played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sex and bulbbin tutors as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand on the game, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract, thereby increasing all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout of 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could endanger at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting mill with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three additional owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through enamelling," the company announced. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they end 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the supplier of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on earnings to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of enamel "does not diminish."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts caution due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 MW and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity every year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it would not be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of Covers was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the kardashian family similar), which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn problem cases and producers of keeping up Ryan Seacause), as they miss the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the stereotyped action of almost every birthday septic of a children's show (Seacause brought the sentence" "You thought that we should have forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of karma has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendalls's big sister Kim might have beaten her, what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more than a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, more" celebrities who mourn "as" Models, are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar Award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youth of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true of Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners likes success not every one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the Mistakes of the Eye."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But getting around on the abnormality seems to pass by the point.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 communicator came to the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euro, lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the age of the internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will provide 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the doubters had wronged in 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of witchcraft growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, who implemented a £11 billion in infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by £16 billion to private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post, in which it was reported that users could update their filters in the program to further block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect what part of the page advertisement is advertised."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin and forth battle between the anti-time open source community and the bypasses has been in progress since the invention of indicating lockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people use display blowers all over the world; almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a highway in a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman laid down in the dark" in an act of despair "on the streets and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was attacked by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police, calling on these and any witnesses of the incident to report themselves."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark ran on the highway, it was decided that the drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway, as was said in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk, and became unconscious in the street, took the court."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a rainbow to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which had previously been suspected by planetary researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years, was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 enterprises in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 percent of the victims paid willingly the ransom paid by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for extorting ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was shocking quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim active, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of CryptoLogic Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware is added."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the companies affected by German companies reported turnover losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acute acute by the loss of acute illnesses."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of downtime in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the usefulness-areas and contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators really try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively low-risk gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware even in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits have been created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The presser then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per inexplicated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals engage spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators rather threaten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the hacker conference" "Defcon", "safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat integrated with the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top falls down somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V for storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a boot space of 453 l with raised and 1026 l in case of backrests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like kinoscopes and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded very well, but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he should, however, do something quieter in his work."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the safety system belongs to the City emergency braking assistant (operates at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane assist system."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates, because it evaluates many obstacles as" "approaching objects" "when maneuvering."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temperature regulator reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, App integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much, will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the wake-ring-ringing no more to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaving, member of the board of the German Society of Sitting and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one sees in the provisionally is the insomnia, i.e. an in- and sleep-disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the sleeping experience many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is often common in a depression," "says Weaving."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to salute everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I check with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"for those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, should go to the doctor, advises weft."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unworn, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleeping specialist in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, advises weft."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for snoring with respirators, in case of abnormal daily fatigue, sleeping converters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze says."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make noonful sleep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cladding, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is drawing on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weft counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not sleeping too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and not at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, some linden trees, in between are a rest of cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that, but the police are among the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"along the road from the east to the west, one passes playgrounds, a newly renovated kindergarten and a biolade."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on the facade of a grey house, someone" ugly "jumped."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new lease flats are to be built."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, articles about this" trendy district, "such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason for this is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have tenants, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner-senator Henkel has had several times advocated for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a" no-go zone "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the Kadatermiths, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, the police patrogated official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the meantime, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the buildings renovated the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others converse before the latter."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection from vandaliasing on the left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between the occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has become a magnet for tourists and pollinators from all over the world in recent years: now residents of East Germany and former domestic occupants share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at the raised panes or freshly painted facades that were thrown with pigments.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "Left Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences make damage to property, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant house beside the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer present in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved to Riga's streets.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important for her to get back to the streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly stressed the district authority over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former building blocks, which the old residents impose."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well disposed of are living here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left-hand scene were part of the neighbourhood."</seg>

<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee responsible for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilksau, which is above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less spotless but rather targeted on the variety of tasks requested - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an eiving Wollmilksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supported hone- and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been a very difficult task for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be intimidating as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school courts, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be woken up or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, work does not only mean labour."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it requires offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too administration and honorary officials are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problems, says customer honestly," people who do nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine customer says quite clearly," what some naive may call. "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitised."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassins had them completely obituated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore main and honorary officials must look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, one needs to help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
