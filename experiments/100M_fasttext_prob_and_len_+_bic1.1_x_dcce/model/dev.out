Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the elections ahead of Israel was rejected . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor calls to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was rit@@ tered on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb standing in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already had 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University polic@@ eman Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons , saying that he had some health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found a trace of Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb ri@@ pped himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said they believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when she met with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all the girls mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ le before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were jo@@ king and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt attended the Memorial Day , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
&quot; Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but toy and baby product dealers say that he will give the currently busy employees and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . during the Christmas season 2014 , some 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December increases .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox out of his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated c@@ row and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; following a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France on the margins of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; ban calls on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in overcoming the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Con@@ ver@@ ting values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Ar@@ rival values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week stated that 60 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , such ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first voting state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively run his office , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they raise their scholars , republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination opposite only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
&quot; a recent C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting Tru@@ mp believe that they have firmly assigned their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration focus was on the public discourse of 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were frustr@@ ated about the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residen@@ ces in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ ie trail is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea att .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a flat roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , meaning it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a bit . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential types , however , the price depends on the price of pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a Sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th match in the Champions League , Müller received a good cooperation from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who caused a che@@ er of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bavaria &apos;s captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed imagination without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus has won his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went courage@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by shifting movement to the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; from the right , Müller had more luck than his flan@@ k fell out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left @-@ upper gate . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as an olymp@@ ic @-@ storm @-@ storm , Ide@@ ye Brown defeated the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct pick @-@ up , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavarian played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to make needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was forbidden .
&quot; for instance , when he had a shot of Ide@@ ye on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , back to muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to do something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another one . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently had provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kers who smo@@ kes have a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in the case of ren@@ unciation the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , higher than 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; the main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared Er@@ ben Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained investig@@ ator H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years has been affected by unemployment , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all building projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological ground care . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman is displaced at the train station in &quot; &quot; Gei@@ sel@@ fri@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; , &quot; the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has caused serious injuries to it according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal track crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the educ@@ ating officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come in question . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created by 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ age that the EU states and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
&quot; so far , the parties involved in the proceedings have agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , a possibility of objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system , which causes the company to punish tax@@ pay@@ ers , enforce national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU @-@ EU ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the employment opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) could be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
where they arose and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative .
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that ming@@ le very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 states of the state should be subsequently possessed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and positively surprised some expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series . &quot;
with &quot; Il@@ linois &quot; ( Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album climbs into the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any season list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic selling pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs have gone , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as a part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he is mainly presenting the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; the audience list@@ ens to the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; plate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank him , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ction
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ st@@ unde is expected to be eag@@ erly awaited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ctions and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after noon and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to give her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday provoked a number of T@@ ory MPs during a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , drew attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been respect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said Labour changes to remove all the idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has T@@ ory chief over the dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with hooks and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle - the shadow of economic ministers - will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also had the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound jump@@ ed up after data , which showed an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to that , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result grew without bonuses in the UK by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and best assessments of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; the shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment of the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sport holding company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one st@@ unt the window . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others emphasize that , after all , Bie@@ ber is just in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No@@ .1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
&quot; both - and indeed - in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger icon owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , the shop has a barbecue that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ hay means . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile allowed itself to be registered by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to be betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash ki@@ cks off ground @-@ breaking campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - inv@@ inci@@ ble
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a fund@@ raising campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Europe . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and € 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and achieves a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ cas@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base , could cost around $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in food and food business fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , supplying about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in the same period of pressure on revenues and margins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a &apos;s chief business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an will grow , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit in four years for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior after the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; became the spotlight due to the in@@ famous discourse of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f ham@@ mer@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am more en@@ vious about is the fact that , after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he &apos;s not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s well in shape , he &apos;s well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ an &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and ear@@ ns all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary accounts for emergency , closes the border , shel@@ ters refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and cleared the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the people trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acting in a country of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people fle@@ eing from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ells insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some exhibited in protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the un@@ corrupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU countries would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand , stretched on Tuesday , in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; declared Inter@@ state spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities tried to cross 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are in the process of quick repair of the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos revers@@ ed the most important crossing of the border near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ ander achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a large margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has slow@@ ed down , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ ander now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
&quot; perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her . &quot;
the views are mixed more strongly with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of voters in the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ ting will also be cited .
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the balance bowl , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decided not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race , increases to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has declined by 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; just as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the voters of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; at the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ ander ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den in line with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters did not believe anything . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server in office as foreign minister continue , most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , though 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good grades in leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democ@@ rat voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to nationwide survey behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters support in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing a lot of support . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and betra@@ yed Tru@@ mp amongst Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ therine , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the deepest point , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - it ends with 19 % support among the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tru@@ mp@@ s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go into the sea any more : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood poll@@ uted with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a har@@ ass@@ ous ritual of a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood were brut@@ ally attacked by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency telephone number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Chief Apostle Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ being on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment of murder of third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also be ac@@ coun@@ table to it , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rise of interest comes , and the land@@ se is dropped , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rise of interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net income subsidies will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is mostly up@@ trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on asset management at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on returns begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in case of interest increase of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop may be ris@@ ky and raises the question of &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed to pay the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , Fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to this date have taken place in a super cycle with an increasing swing in GDP and before rec@@ essions were put into the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; when bor@@ rowing , the yields appear to change as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / reduction occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond issues fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer ties between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ in @-@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy . &quot;
&quot; companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit from this , when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt will be worse since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively for three months after initial interest increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with low quality by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher returns , even if experts in different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster because of its &quot; &quot; stup@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only decim@@ ated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; asser@@ ts a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish itself from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC General Director pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the start of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er would have to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire came under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; &quot; special BBC mode &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when the next time it was an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed down the expenditure in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ its itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times watched the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could deter purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has found out that £ 5 spending has been issued online by £ 5 .
&quot; in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mec@@ ca during crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial places in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia in part charges the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane was killed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ ch@@ ee .
&quot; gri@@ eving , largely dressed in white , the distance to clo@@ g their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession took place at the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the praying . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
the bodies of 29 persons killed when a crane top@@ pled by the Great Mas@@ mo@@ z@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have let the arm of the crane stop when he was not used .
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ ch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ ch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi dy@@ nasty family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a apost@@ ate son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government representatives stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries will get half of this amount .

&quot; if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; British employ more and more arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items through women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group paid the cost of closing the shops . &quot;
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in front of court
&quot; on Wednesday , the Austrian court of K@@ lagen@@ furt took on two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and sharing . &quot;
the accused were not guilty .
one of them had also been indic@@ ted for official abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds from the association accounts they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around € 400@@ ,000 . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chair of the Senate Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no point was the association created an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials only charged allowance damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , from debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read profession of major audi@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to put our life insur@@ ances as security in the bank , &quot; he said at the time of recording . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debts can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the payout of allowance damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; that is why one paid off a part of the allowance damages only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , package and not detailed accounting appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial support , it is important that only debt relief has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , declared the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent did not know a long answer .
&quot; after all , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; claim compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With whom are you all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; for Di@@ ets , he charged the association 1,000 euros a month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
the accused were not able to show precise documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept up after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the arrangements were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his hom@@ etown of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reduction which has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese in the division of the company will build further jobs . &quot;
the positions in the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) terri@@ fic system do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring process , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5,000 jobs has not been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share gave 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting itself up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be recorded on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services were recently awarded the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and get more and more business online .
&quot; overall , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 5@@ 5.000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would largely be reluc@@ tant : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent said appro@@ v@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian leader Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed said , would be 20 per cent . &quot;
29 percent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro @-@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Conn@@ ected Mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can attend the International Motor Show ( IAA ) from Saturday .
&quot; as two years ago , the organisers of the car association V@@ DA expect approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the point control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen stood a water @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially stopped pe@@ pper@@ ing spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; now , the refugees have withdrawn somewhat . &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees have bag@@ ged themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ men also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion , was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 clock ME@@ Z on Thursday
letters of Death at the Delta State University left an ap@@ ology
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; officials announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers needed to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surround him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb ph@@ oned at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the Delta State University as a PhD in his life on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this is for sure his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot @-@ union .
the Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a governing board for Lufthansa in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , representing a quarter of annual sales of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot &apos;s association &quot; &quot; Cockpit &quot; &quot; ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed again on this Thursday after the strike . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record result , cockpit wool &quot; &quot; wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transition to the pilot , the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept is used . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa trains routes to the company &apos;s own equity @-@ line Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outer defender to the weeping and closing it for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double score and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about that . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a leg frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take a long time until you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything beautiful and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ prints an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , reading . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was l@@ ur@@ king and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears Th@@ need stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a high @-@ spir@@ ited , sn@@ app@@ y creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a reverse victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th dies from England &apos;s test cad@@ re , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is hard to analyse , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even though he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I intim@@ id@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must at least have the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to bring mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t hit there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Devil &apos;s sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred p@@ ranks right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers voted for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not define the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain out of the EU ) could gain momentum when the economy is in a f@@ lau@@ te until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ vent ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold the UK in the EU will go deeper every day even without the choice of geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who viol@@ ently cut off because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always at its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they mostly do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to welcome an outside UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the over@@ stated long exp@@ atri@@ ates such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande faces his re @-@ election or sub@@ stitution in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even deliberately not plan useful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the Great Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ natives who own most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but realized that when sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having dinner and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the not adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door to him . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly plum@@ b on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I just express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ f@@ stoff tendency and the wild fo@@ unds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can probably say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary called &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their clause day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up Image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the fund@@ raising campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks this way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege industry , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managers had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also under@@ signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive means from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he has received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s research work is called &quot; &quot; be@@ zeich@@ ung &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage to most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J were already responded to . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ er@@ or , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er@@ or and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financed programs that could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I have to look at how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ er@@ . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion dollars of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; on the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee , &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we all think you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and entertaining the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; impulses work by turning Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to form a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultr@@ asonic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they switch on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; said Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have been angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to the student residence halls ranges from easily nerve @-@ stirring up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to be wat@@ ered : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with regard to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and put their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receives a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; since you start university at the climax of back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , this is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if there was something for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , closed their door and went to their three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be so deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future sp@@ ouses to go back and see them again and see them every day , and perhaps see how they all come across all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your submission a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good st@@ ink is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable , am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not attack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , low @-@ income &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the bene@@ fici@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people are staying in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending d@@ amo@@ cles value special construction and the parking place ordin@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gill@@ an : true is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but it was built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling us that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely by merging the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone might turn off half way and lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our check@@ list of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect themselves , if they do . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system . &quot;
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only de@@ vot@@ ee : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup second stressed the seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the so @-@ called twelve races of the season and is also launching the Fl@@ ut@@ licht Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current Smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer chess club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has recorded another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein received . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot afford membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
lod@@ gings are looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ven have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consultations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
a new district office was recently opened .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care insurance benefits . &quot;
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions here .
&quot; not many performances of the insurance companies are not rarely used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally complementary .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre is particularly apparent in demographic change .
&quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg is essential in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ s Office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
the Social Foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently as possible in their familiar environment as possible .
&quot; the lod@@ gings are open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot;

&quot; we are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage , now we have planning security , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Hü@@ mmer , who also points out the ticket sales that are now launched . &quot;
it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
&quot; we therefore hope for many spectators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ lights have a special appeal . &quot;
&quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bamberg moved by victories in the District of FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Regi@@ on@@ alli@@ g@@ sten 1st FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus informed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the show . &quot;

&quot; in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot;

men check on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on their way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three people .
one of these men was now crying out to the young people and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a stock@@ pile , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
&quot; so far , there is only a vag@@ ue sight of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks for witnesses and advis@@ ors to report to the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ hal@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ hal@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the fields of the field were met years ago by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently taking part in specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply called it . &quot;
the Müller liked the idea of running its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mill@@ er . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle as a family doctor . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need more room .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the garbage can get a total of 50,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German A@@ verage practice there are about 500 . &quot;
there is another medical practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ hal@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , by the way also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the fields of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already felt it after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; her husband is compl@@ em@@ enting : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always been de@@ pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can do this &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances set up corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; so this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar saw , however , not in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenian will not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government told , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly hit police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country is counting around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to propose people to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were on the road all night long , from the 500 @-@ kilometre @-@ away Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
thus it could indeed come to a somewhat far@@ ther west route to the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was preparing for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; he did not call the details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform rigorous checks in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently received a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm down Wednesday at a local apparent in Hor@@ gos : he is holding the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian Refu@@ gee Workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war , still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police revealed that a team of mine @-@ clean@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the information collected , in@@ sider trading should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were reported . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot;

most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce pointed out its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite well faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks like the volunteers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant spontaneously moves to the chal@@ k and the sentence &quot; &quot; my life watched &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; can read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; not everyone wants to communicate openly on the boards , but understand@@ ably , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the opening of the people . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed financial prospects for 2016 lowered
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect comes in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nevertheless expected that earnings before the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
analysts surv@@ eyed six of Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in the body transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , in order to decide whether it is time to raise the cor@@ p@@ ses for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story se@@ at@@ ee , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself insur@@ es the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the strike by promising that another increase is far removed . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is going to act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world ended up at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a bit this month , whereby the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process technically . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varnis@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest in interest , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its cor@@ p@@ ses by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limited noticeable impact on growth in the US , &quot; says Lack@@ er . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives have revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not near this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise of interest because the markets upset him , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / bearing was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; with her 74 L@@ enzen , she is still fond of teaching . &quot;
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric association Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet generally affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ bar Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn @-@ down construction at the amber sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the Panel had adopted a proposal for a &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ enclosed first and roof top &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this enables us to create a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; the roof @-@ tilt , which for energy @-@ related reasons , was prescribed - unlike in the construction plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; in respect of the roof @-@ tilt , whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually proceeds more restric@@ tively in the event of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , the hall@@ way construction is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes promotion .
&quot; in the next process step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
&quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees , move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board failed to make a decision , and conven@@ ed on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further interior ward .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace at Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only started medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; came into play with the question of who was ready to take over the leadership and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this , in any case , signi@@ fies an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fis@@ her with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the jail , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurbish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily storage .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fis@@ her about the qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive and understanding &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Neck@@ ar are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but no one exists . &quot;

Jag@@ usi@@ an with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police told . &quot;
after a shooting a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
&quot; what exactly happened to the accident , was at first unclear . &quot;
the C@@ ID is determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missed since Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old also arrested on Tuesday evening , who indeed indicated the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning , after she had not come home after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing ones , a crime came up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him . &quot;
disclosure of the immediate circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seekers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the association &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with 14@@ 0.000 flats are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first reception . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have lived for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to rising refugee numbers . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing development policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals stayed in large cities into WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
&quot; due to the f@@ lau@@ te on the housing market , young adults stayed un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has dropped again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Sozial@@ er idential Building &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should stimulate social housing construction again . &quot;
this could be wai@@ ved on the under@@ tak@@ ings tax and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed housing is subject to limited time .
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ duction options are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around € 300 million were raised on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia serve corridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no pass through , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the rub@@ b@@ ish of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both with the bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot over the green border . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter borders . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the border crossing bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 un@@ challenged people . &quot;
shortly before the closing event on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws reserve the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
convic@@ ted sentences of arrest for up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two older people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped . &quot;
&quot; practically no one has any chance to get granted asylum in Hungary , however . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers begin to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people left on the road for the past few weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the record bearings in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for Germany to continue their journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany surprisingly set off rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we once cooked the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with a snack and a drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire department .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try the rail transport to Germany after the short notice , but to try to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly tra@@ cked the attitude of the Hungarian government into the city of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the close winter to make decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quar@@ ry &quot;
Konrad has all the hands full to do with the spreading of refugees .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to raise ag@@ ri for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first reception centre has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ful year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial captains .
they would have assured him of creating a quarter for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also expects great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped that hotels in the winter are empty . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that the lod@@ gings must have a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the upper duties . &quot;
&quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad explains with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not speak of fal@@ seh@@ ood without further ado . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ite the Republic to bear any costs , as they themselves declared . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
his own qu@@ art search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently refrain from taking these measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , additional locations should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) ordered the further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; however , the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls to its borders is a logical result for &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the German course of action . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially closed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) shall be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T at the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2,@@ 700 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ cub@@ ator opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Bru@@ eit wanted to lay a dog . &quot;
&quot; the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni was forced to post@@ p@@ one this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been reconstructed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open another store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the large area of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has brought Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into rap@@ ture , the expert is not able to answer with last certainty . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is upgraded to every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself hostile to journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire originate . &quot;
the New Yorker experiences a term in the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tru@@ mp .
what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they think that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter fashion , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous offspring , among which alongside Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a locomotive for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
foundation stone of the real estate company was first estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland long , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once went without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Dog@@ s , Roland Paul , had declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes ambig@@ uous statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he says , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans dis@@ soci@@ ably , &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 female singers , also in the United States awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian Municip@@ ality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s evaluations . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , moved to London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today reported a slight rise in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , Sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father , who decided to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 was full . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret is revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood ultimately lands in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you might have acci@@ dentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood stays firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game corrupt who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set to him without reservation , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his dar@@ ing catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a P@@ unt that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass was leading to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters are demanding the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn session in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Di@@ et faction of the Free voters is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
&quot; actually , entirely different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is over@@ shad@@ owed by the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as was during the war in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so we don &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Di@@ vot@@ er . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ van@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need nationwide standardised standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves off , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more emp@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy should not fall under the table in large wall@@ stadt .
a long standing burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Central Level plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school grade of three to four years has been tested . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want this .
free travel at the G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
tigh@@ ten Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on jumps
the German stock market closed ten@@ der@@ less and nervous trading history with profits after a long distance .
&quot; only in the afternoon was a strong start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately transported the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the Tec@@ D@@ ax technology @-@ resistant Tec@@ D@@ ax increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as the index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also earned the trading posts in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index posted some 1 percent in the Plus segment . &quot;
&quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to be in place until after the compo@@ unding decision in the U.S. , and also for the great decline in the fut@@ ures markets . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the share of RW@@ E shares in the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record deep and left deep traces in E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares climbed by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US startup magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors gave a little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in this context , investments in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out . &quot;
&quot; car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were again set off than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the car owners Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits were about 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; at the German pension market , the return on exchange of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x retirement index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation &apos;s Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the price of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro . &quot;
4 people killed after polic@@ emen sho@@ ot@@ gun at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police missi@@ les shot into a crowd against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before moving back on rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used are known to kill them , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously producing such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i state that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Sub@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations from the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled over centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
building site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ de Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter surface .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter site in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is called the city . &quot;
which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were signed yet . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner big street , already purchased a few months ago and the building can be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday home on the little sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
some tra@@ ilers are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure area
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , bur@@ dened , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday home on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends met with the system construction management : &quot; we haven &apos;t answered all questions yet , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro projects have been in discussion for months .
&quot; intense reactions among sea owners , who had come to the meeting , called the images and new details on the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the mer@@ rier and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block over@@ looked by all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , like several other project critics , he fears that the transport by the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : &quot; there must be full bus loads to be reck@@ oned with , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the construction plans were still variable . &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign calling for $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European Nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / , low to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation , s@@ unk from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and 28 % in total . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) , and recorded rather a complete Over@@ coming of the Diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years compared to a group using conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly paying attention to fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the present circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions such as true peace and genuine evolution , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 have reported the toxic@@ ity control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them landing in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how you@@ thful disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have pur@@ port@@ edly bl@@ ended disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sy@@ ringe can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip around whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry du@@ b@@ bing disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold observed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah rang out her words , and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; over alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; the police concerned the sworn planned plan as &quot; &quot; suppl@@ em@@ enting &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in the event of a rear @-@ end collision between the Nor@@ dr@@ ing and the Her@@ pa , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car was injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and realized that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck to the rear of an audi@@ s , leaving this vehicle on a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the accident @-@ accident @-@ involved vehicles , there was a damage of about 10,000 euros , the police reported . &quot;

D@@ ons increase tour through Celtic to five points
&quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ ra@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays down talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control because they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dutch - De Bo@@ er
&quot; former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; at the moment de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about returning the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of tension in the old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars to Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel the same - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January @-@ transfers
&quot; despite his comments , a few weeks ago that indicated that he hur@@ ried some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; players who come in summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in Po@@ kal@@ plays or Li@@ gen , the games of this kind have not won times . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising in the UK overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the rate of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Bureau ( O@@ NS ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland accounted for 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except in late legal intervention , I will see how a man is killed . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and since there are often more applications available than seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ep@@ ad and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying out of death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he was persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police was launched on Tuesday for a break @-@ off incident in Beck@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape the alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy asser@@ ts that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy asser@@ ts that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the race sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ shot test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging bun@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk about the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before that , M@@ oo@@ dy had the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now considering . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ folded Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ tags treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which was contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been like yesterday all the day , which was also the case . &quot;
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after cur@@ sing arrested
the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ am on the weekend .
the cycli@@ st was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
&quot; the police said , the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia became the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for manoeu@@ vre @-@ cur@@ sing and under@@ las@@ hed assistance and for other traffic off@@ enses .
&quot; the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ am , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for claims of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy called cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favourites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ er@@ g of his team and said they were focused solely on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading coaches in his team were confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring battles when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical a real focus , and this has provided us with a turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not accustomed to losing it so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this time is coming up again and again .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they can . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters made a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team was free on this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks in the pre @-@ final at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Serbian with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café it could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal act , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
&quot; in the event of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried to avoid , at the last moment , to turn left , as the police told . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ cause demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a girl op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through and found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; gave up a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent paintings on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused pc and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court on 24 March this year . &quot;
advoc@@ ate advoc@@ ate Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g was not appearing in the registry of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his arrest .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases still pending . &quot;
he was included before the date of judgment in the registry of the sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ ages caused fear of discovery and sei@@ zing people on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river Inn river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and traffic guns .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner from tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm @-@ birds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea @-@ circle with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hour kilometers . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun once more can be seen again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is above all moving to the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were attributable to this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public@@ ation stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new premium cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
one of the major premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra that will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a new entry under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; furthermore , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door version in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in trade , he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan client wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
the sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented above all on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the judicial authority of Te@@ gel , which had been housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with its constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : it was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on his own free foot , had been moved into a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , from the question@@ able period of time only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are authorit@@ ative , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law . &quot;
&quot; thus , in April , they said to a det@@ ain@@ ee , because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human dignity is also un@@ worthy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had reached an in@@ decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot;
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had hit the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore locked up again and again 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to clubs it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed because of lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is going on in Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees according to the German Federal Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that , and we can create that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing prices fall out of the rental price , and in order to promote these particularly favourable dwell@@ ings , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , scientists and federal mini@@ stries are unanim@@ ous that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to th@@ ron@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment to refugees for the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residen@@ cy to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , there is a majority of the perspectives that refugees should be allowed more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is therefore based on th@@ ru@@ by of the Royal Road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only once important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ er@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle no federal land banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
study @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a rep@@ ay@@ ment or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any benefits according to the asylum rate law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the entitled persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 this span was shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g right away .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually implement the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association is also important to take care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes readiness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more important than today will be a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will need to change , and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities Act for a decade .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German demand long and require international agreements like anti @-@ racism convention in Germany , must become reality in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and make use of its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical attention to the refugees until now , &quot; writes Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately . &quot;
services rendered may later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
&quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited service catalog , which the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers open . &quot;
&quot; even so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that immigrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , they demand . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , under refugee children there are clearly more untreated people with disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlightenment . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other types of disease , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , even relief in sight may be affected by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the TU Munich att@@ ests to the fact that every fifth Syrian refugee woman arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and deaths . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong shock and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , mentally ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices there are mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sur@@ es and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the Man@@ ege on the brick and v@@ ases to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ e@@ gen@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them to another world for two hours , &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ avi@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo stri@@ ves to absorb . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer female hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ages , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ cle@@ arity . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yuan there is no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated by her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst is also taking a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the upper@@ most commandment therefore : care for the animals .
&quot; the Pro@@ bst family is proud of its zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid hasn &apos;t yet been ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 people , we always do our best and we are with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September , every day at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread through social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of opposition members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; death &quot; , &quot; he told journalists according to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies later this year , separating computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected down@@ turn results in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ available , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; an explanation of the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the depar@@ tures from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Ar@@ senal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and as long as his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere disorders since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture of Ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and regain strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ senal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger is turning a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to give a small break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favourites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal won the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by the far hope to lead the club to its first European oc@@ co triumph with its management . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ senal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high prove . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the men to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally sound friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful even though in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ amed through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely relate to them , even if they are often reluc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone souls told me : ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair too , long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the fully re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria goes on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris requires a strong start against Swedish masters , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a clas@@ h game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later moved to play against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals scored . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was raised by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested why when he went in to Joh@@ an Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic hit in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and abandoned after Cav@@ ani after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he showed a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth Se@@ as@@ ons after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
&quot; the Swiss mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is resident in Switzerland , is affected by a stock sales of 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday , as part of its huge debt collection plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion to pay off their own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the subscription rights issue brought Gl@@ en@@ cores stock exchange rate to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the early Wednesday morning trade .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ en@@ core announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the group . &quot;
&quot; concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago , just before Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times championship winner , four times champion league player , twice club champion , two times champion champion , two times champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club after Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already in front of the Euro Cup before the European Championship 2008 . &quot;
it was told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record meister : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; he has got me excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows what Bavaria &apos;s playing time would have run with X@@ av@@ i 2008 / 2009 .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , the Red Army switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film production
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives while empha@@ sizing a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cking , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments by the actor of The Mar@@ tian re@@ acted . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined producers colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a mare beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval by Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to resort to discrimin@@ atory practices against living conditions . &quot;
&quot; in February , singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement has published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox @-@ News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ ber and manipul@@ ator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the great prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who finished all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task in time with which he was the first ath@@ lete , who completed the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news of the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock of winning the big prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; Isaac said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first ever to finish the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great sati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a vertical relay and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb inside a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside for 6 times and enabled three branches .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in Bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ man Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the punch wood well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a two @-@ run away from the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th consecutive time in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
&quot; after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , Berlin made an R@@ BI double against the cre@@ ek of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit stood for the opening of the game by a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been das@@ hed out of the injury list before the game , after he lack@@ ed more than one month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z completed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to go to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers ranked in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ine right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four strips . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throwing school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is das@@ hed from the infrin@@ gement list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 . &quot;
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden arrived on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 new refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily under@@ mine .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen , according to the government president responsible for the first time . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; collective om@@ is@@ sion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup had passed by a military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict goes crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one is sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner , who had already had talks between the General Director for Public Security and Ag@@ ents of Germany . &quot;
she did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt on the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee trage@@ dies in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , and announced on Tuesday night after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also complain . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a pencil , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this notion has been intim@@ ately divided in the round .
&quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
&quot; in the night on Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to seal the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of further migrants were on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds an ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
a global ocean sw@@ apped under the ice @-@ tap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
this is followed by researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon ra@@ ges slightly on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this num@@ b movement is only small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water has to be given .
&quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
1860 München has to for@@ ego Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an examination resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association . &quot;
R@@ ama lam@@ ented over pain already at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to take four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the ability to prove his ability . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie returns to the team &apos;s training session . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious blu@@ ep@@ rint . &quot;
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ go contains relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ go contains a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat fruits support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly sm@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; the color of the bowl alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to hearty dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS brings up to 9@@ 5000 assistance for Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company has already begun recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS extended its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first flush , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ dal side of the F@@ öhn breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland told on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ner valleys . &quot;
&quot; after fo@@ stering on Thursday morning a distinctive cold @-@ front crosses us , which brings powerful rain , wind @-@ bu@@ cks and a temperature back . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west@@ erly direction . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the night of the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn is able to advance in places to the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees l@@ ends , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the mountain . &quot;
&quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours , over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , this after large rainf@@ all has already occurred over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow dryer leaves the air , subsequently a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind pi@@ cks up strongly to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures rise significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill has been christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded me that Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could often live only in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ ine mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he perceived the city as a bl@@ am@@ eless sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
&quot; with his thes@@ es , Luther had initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ las@@ h@@ ment . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt did for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on themes such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current contexts into the present day . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
&quot; embedded between the original scrip@@ tural quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , he formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work with the Lord , perhaps to work with the Lord again . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to bring art again to greater importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbo@@ lism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully capture the Bible , but also selected the important , also mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; that was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text simply explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X trains
&quot; a year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured a breach , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ ping , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; approval will take place in October , the first common @-@ party Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will be even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its engagement for refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the situation escal@@ ating in Germany and safegu@@ ards the policy of its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic certainly plays a key role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and might help .
but the crucial course must be policy .
&quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal libraries also support this program .
&quot; as early as this weekend , the 36 pros get a clear signal when they are on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . we will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports boss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on every one , no one is allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; no , we have to use our jet power , our influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim , managing director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects , was great . &quot;
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses sight in the event of accident
&quot; according to the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the left eye has been lost due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is present at the meeting and is &quot; full of work . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ thing can happen . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you fell . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ eted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; as a spare driver for the two common denom@@ inations Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , he is just as little as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of Marco Re@@ us &apos;s com@@ eback in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high intensity of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem eleven at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of regular keeper Roman citizenship . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; though Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel was open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner statement from fellow @-@ player Re@@ us , that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l comprehensible : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot car : government wants to play a leading role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that will also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport policy paper stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick shift to digital radio communication . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , &quot; no additional liability risks shall be applied to the driver , &quot; the Federal Government intends to examine the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government also plans to make use of a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ een the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , car @-@ free vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected only after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the testing organisation Dek@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , and 32 percent do not believe it at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents were charged with autonomous driving cars by 20@@ 25 , 33 percent in the US . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
&quot; after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could well imagine 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ Euro
&quot; according to current status , the Düsseldorf will only strike the title of the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said the coach builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; said Individu@@ al European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the result list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also missing , and we became Europe champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the Wel@@ d@@ gli@@ sten Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United paid a serious injury to the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis indicated the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow @-@ player from Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ itz to a sh@@ ot@@ gun .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially reno@@ unc@@ ing attitude toward a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ c@@ ely far @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not structured chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ o the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers travelled to Munich for 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tender @-@ like fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) , he dressed his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
to play with a doll his parents would not have allowed him .
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he could not pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in a large quantity for customers , who , for example , processed them to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener summit , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already doing half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been dis@@ continued . &quot;
there are almost no private specialized stores and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products are hardly available to customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; also weak@@ est exports , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points also by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; for this year we have been leading a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; graduated designer , U@@ te Schmidt , teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; to offset the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; a tension line arises between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the businesses , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small chi@@ cks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ ly Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener summit . &quot;
now she uses the snow ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a souvenir . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener summit .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director says : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group entrusted with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident status system . &quot;
&quot; following the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus exploit consumers with a significantly higher dose of neur@@ ons .
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mistaken industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent should be lifted for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily loaded with mercury that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p usually are so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ urt is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which is heavily accum@@ ulating in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is therefore warned that &quot; &quot; small amounts of particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system can cause &quot; &quot; already low quantities . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explained on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily used by the combustion of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal @-@ fired power stations attract more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted out of paper in March . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
