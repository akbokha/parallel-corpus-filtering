&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I on safety measures .
the aim of the preventive measures outlined in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a turn by risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target defined in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the amount of material not proven for a certain period is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified seas .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization as@@ signs 3 full use of the association &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the Community shall make use of the methods and measures of the following kinds and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely identified and useful in supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) ass@@ essing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proced@@ ures to evaluate clusters of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions ensuring that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Convention shall not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit described in the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the association of the organisation divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) its core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear materials under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the prerequisites specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is , however , deemed that the recovery of nuclear materials which is subject to this Convention is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the Organization and the Community shall consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear materials under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the Organisation and the Community are unanim@@ ously aware that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation acqu@@ ires the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when it is used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards provided that the total material quantity delivered in the States due to this article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear materials that are subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material will be taken .
the association meets with the organization Suppl@@ ementary forms , which are necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in particular to determine how the procedures set out in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the States undertake every effort to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organisation represents a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sour@@ Centr@@ ran@@ s@@ ment problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organisation establishes a special account under the term &quot; Special Sum@@ mary Account &quot; which is made up of the funds which the Member States will contribute to the Special Inter@@ action Account under this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; by the organization as the Administrator , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the concerned State at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment takes place in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time that was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator under consideration of the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments on request before the above mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual method of organisation , the administrator takes approximately proportional moves to cash or the ho@@ e @-@ j@@ unks to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate the special action account in an appropriate manner .
when granting this loan , the administrator can derive from the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit transfer capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each promotion loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ pri@@ cel@@ ess development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and managed for the organisation funded by the organization , taking into account the pre@@ am@@ ble of this agreement .
the means of an action account must not be used instead of the means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of age in each case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts for payment of this charge are to be paid directly to the organization which it retains .
each loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is given in particular .
income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or furnished in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and that may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special action loan after the administrator at the time of the loan guarantee .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are carried out on the special action account , and the amount returned in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible .
the supervis@@ or shall notify the EEC as to the full disclosure of all the special transactions by the directors in preparation and about the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of payment of the Special Inter@@ action Lo@@ an , the administrator holds the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure made for this .
as soon as possible after the end of the financial year , the administrator conve@@ ys a detailed billing of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this statement of accounts .
after payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC shall report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special action account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and maintains appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special action account , the amounts paid out of the accounts recei@@ vable and paid amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments made to the member states .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EW@@ G ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards until the full edition of the means of the special action account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special action account , the continuation of programs or plans financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall become invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this Agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate their procedures .
the Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a No@@ tification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording being equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T issued the following VER@@ Y :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large research facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common company under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint company J@@ ET . &quot;
for several years Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question .
since there is still extensive work to be carried out until the practical use of the monitored nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and accelerate their respective research work , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to benefit from a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both the research work and thus the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity production by using the controlled core fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is amended or amended by the bodies mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the parties accept a new program , this occurs at the place of the program listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association intended in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;

in view of the association concluded in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those concluded between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ate organs , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland , at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , takes part in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the Joint Business J@@ ET with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , its statutes it accepts .
Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and of the Federal Council .

in the form of a correspondence to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition to simpli@@ fying the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the case of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears that the agreement contains an article 12 to include .
I permit you to confirm the consent of the Community regarding these changes , and suggest that the entry into force is 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; recei@@ v@@ ables as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit transactions with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion account units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery investment funds from the member countries .
already , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be prepared .
in each stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing dies will not be made before one month after the stand@@ by agreement is concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods considered taking account of the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the required funds on the market , the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled cer@@ eal , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina have to be set at the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and / or is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change of the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that Argentina &apos;s access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community under@@ takes to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of articles from this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount determined under number 2 in accordance with the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will take account of the de@@ ple@@ tion of de@@ ple@@ tion referred to in number 5 .
the total amount stated under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community at 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the Community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sale of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products referred to in the number 1 .
the association ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent upon the submission of an export license which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence is wai@@ ved for the products in question .
in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall inform the competent authority of the Community at regular intervals the amounts that have been issued for the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deco@@ ded according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works flaw@@ lessly .
he regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions that are of significance for the purpose mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this Agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the agreement .
the committee will discuss all issues arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends the appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount determined under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity applicable from the entry into force of this agreement up to 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total amount of the year and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement are reviewed by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 in view of changes that they consider necessary for necessary .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to propose that if your government can agree with the above that this letter and your reply form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I impl@@ ore you to let you know that my government can agree with the above and that your letter and reply form together an agreement according to your suggestion .
in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled cer@@ eal , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ cation 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen mus@@ sels , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ cation 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are stipulated in the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is performed in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change of the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the joint market regulated by this agreement is not affected by it .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community under@@ takes to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of articles from this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
by joining new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 in accordance with the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will take account of the de@@ ple@@ tion of de@@ ple@@ tion referred to in number 5 .
the total amount stated under number 2 is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community at 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the Community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions , so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an works of art due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products referred to in the number 1 .
the association ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent upon the submission of an export license which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority shall inform the competent authority of the Community at regular intervals the amounts that have been issued for the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deco@@ ded according to country of destination if necessary .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the one hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement are reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) Hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by re @-@ di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at the time standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter den@@ otes the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the international standard preparations present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a national body preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary characteristics should be preserved for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a liquid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents contained on the label is based on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation attempts ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ us pent@@ oxide in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic are added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfil the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ori@@ fic or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in a p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic form or after the recovery process , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until an International Convention on a uniform system has come about .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may possibly be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ charging ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , has the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
