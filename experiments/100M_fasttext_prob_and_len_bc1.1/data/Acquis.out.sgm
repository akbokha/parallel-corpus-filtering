<seg id="727">The supplemental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the States undertake every effort to make these agreements enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report published in Article 62, the organisation represents a summarized inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention in the states, regardless of its origin, and continues this inventory on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general ressourCentrransment problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation establishes a special account under the term "Special Summary Account" which is made up of the funds which the Member States will contribute to the Special Interaction Account under this Agreement; this account is referred to as "Administrator" by the organization as the Administrator, and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the concerned State at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment takes place in two instalments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time that was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator under consideration of the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State can make payments on request before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual method of organisation, the administrator takes approximately proportional moves to cash or the hoe-junks to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate the special action account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting this loan, the administrator can derive from the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its additional credit transfer capacity to loan conditions without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each promotion loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly-priceless development programme or project (including a sectoral project) regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation's loan programme or not, according to procedures and practices, which are considered, approved and managed for the organisation funded by the organization, taking into account the preamble of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of an action account must not be used instead of the means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in ten years of age in each case.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this charge are to be paid directly to the organization which it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or furnished in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and that may be beneficiaries of a special action loan after the administrator at the time of the loan guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are carried out on the special action account, and the amount returned in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The supervisor shall notify the EEC as to the full disclosure of all the special transactions by the directors in preparation and about the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the Special Interaction Loan, the administrator holds the EWG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible after the end of the financial year, the administrator conveys a detailed billing of the transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization to this statement of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="756">After payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC shall report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special action account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and maintains appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special action account, the amounts paid out of the accounts receivable and paid amounts paid to the account and the repayments made to the member states.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EWG (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the stewards until the full edition of the means of the special action account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special action account, the continuation of programs or plans financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the organisation may agree, the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall become invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
