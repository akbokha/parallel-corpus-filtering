this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. chao@@ tic thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where the patients have alternate episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients responding to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for intake or the enam@@ el tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who simultaneously take other medicines , which are also broken down like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to normal@@ ising the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recovery .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours compared with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for taking it ( records ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo for the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased rest@@ less and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , nausea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in cases of bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ ro@@ cel@@ i@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appear in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a CN@@ S , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies there was a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sis , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ulation and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combination of bi@@ polar agents , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , care should be taken if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level before the accompanying treatment begins .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ ry ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns caused during animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative effects on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole posted a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ l@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
there is no information on the efficacy of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma rot@@ ein band@@ aging .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
when applying Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor li@@ g@@ ands , the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ test .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents &apos; response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher drop in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an op@@ en@@ capsul@@ ated , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and an effect effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period of over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole proved to be superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ pment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary Time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , with Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ sm over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific analysis on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular hazard to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
additionally , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of monkeys after repeated oral dosing from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate Sul@@ ph@@ ate concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solution .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose .

the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .

dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an op@@ en@@ capsul@@ ated , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study where pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by det@@ aching adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy M@@ elt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection in patients with ag@@ gra@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure decrease ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ ro@@ cel@@ i@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sis , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ulation and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combination ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the all@@ u@@ vial administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers were in@@ tra @-@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level before the accompanying treatment begins .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were in@@ tra @-@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ though gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 . the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies with or@@ ally addressing Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gra@@ dation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed medium improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gra@@ dation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents &apos; response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher drop in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an op@@ en@@ capsul@@ ated , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 ) .
111 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole proved to be superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg of intra@@ muscular complaints .
in studies of the reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety sp@@ ac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular hazard to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
additionally , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of monkeys after repeated oral dosing from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effects of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) were compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el remedies does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached to Grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected , cardiac sur@@ geons in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in the case of diar@@ rho@@ ea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients with the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual eme@@ tics and sti@@ cking methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable prevention method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sper@@ mac@@ ular treatment before the treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machines .
the most common and most common adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer were reported once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ed ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects that have occurred in connection with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in @-@ line case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and there was no caus@@ al correlation with these events established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ is@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the mat@@ ur@@ ation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ oc@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor area due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two mono@@ gam@@ ated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre @-@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of the patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose of m@@ am@@ mal carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Clear@@ ance was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data is available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ ised drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , precau@@ tions should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , we are inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
after complete adding of the solution , the flow bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the flow bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ pipe of the powder is carried out .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the flow bottle must again be gently inver@@ ted in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ cul@@ ation before the application .

• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • Provi@@ de clear imaging of the correct application of the product provided by the patient .
this means that it is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood flow before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable it to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ wn fl@@ amed stre@@ amed to those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients were converted to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stab@@ bing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other components .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that according to the provisions of the European Union , it was proven that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces fl@@ amed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
August 2007 the European Commission issued approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of mis@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma receiving chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned major operating procedures requiring a large amount of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or under the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose needed for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose needed for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the starting value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number is increased by ≥ 1 g / kg ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value , a response to the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed foods is required , should be given to Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme - so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the stre@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any fl@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
the use of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of function , a reduction in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the common causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte figures are normal , and if no other cause of an action loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row is considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit recommended in section 4.2 of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ise @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is due to the addition of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit recommended in section 4.2 of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa @-@ administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ induced an@@ a@@ emia ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the beginning of epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk for post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be insp@@ ected and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose to be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumour tissue , there are no indications of interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
cardiovascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , ret@@ in@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , as well as patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can come to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically based epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ nec@@ ological cancers , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) .
in 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , 4@@ 78 other ) and 8@@ 02 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis .
survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed an un@@ resolved , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and during inspections .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative effect on overall survival may not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last administration .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 in animal studies with approximate 20 times of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa led to reduced federal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro results with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the owner of the licensing for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is applied to transport .
the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market under@@ takes to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ eu@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan and additional measures on pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance as specified in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. as well as any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information that could affect the current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical risk or risk reduction ) • upon request by the E@@ MEA
• have suffered a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of bleeding in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if , for example , such a blood crop has occurred with you , for example ,
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can come within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ depend@@ ant rise in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ builds again during further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the start of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely was er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria , it will break down your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
with elevated or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may consider dis@@ ruption to the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically apparent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age symptoms due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 weeks delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dose accordingly in order to keep the risk of a blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past have already occurred th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour under certain conditions .
if a major orthop@@ edic operation is available to you , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the beginning of the treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you shouldn &apos;t get Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / applying other medicines or have recently taken / used it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedies for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means of building the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you get regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , regular blood tests will be performed by the attending physician .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sy@@ ringe Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .

when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded .
ac@@ last@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with high frac@@ tures risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the treatment of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches in the three days following in@@ fusion .
to treat the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 senior women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood is norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in plac@@ ebo .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion body and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be acet@@ ylene for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications how to apply the medicine , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for placing Ac@@ last@@ a in the entire European Union .

the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • Con@@ contrast indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg of Ac@@ last@@ a IV in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the administration of acet@@ one in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease in Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acet@@ one in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data about safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are limited clinical experiences for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( poor oral hygiene ) should be inter@@ woven with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who require dental interventions , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw@@ s .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of pre@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious side effects was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ ebo ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney Dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d was associated with kidney function disorders , which were referred to as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine levels within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium @-@ values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently built hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the in@@ fusion body , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area were performed , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s at one treated with acet@@ one and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a dose of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the stem size ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
people aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire waist by 6.0 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ one ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic area .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ C ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of time during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % after 12 months compared to the bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mortality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with acet@@ one compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the treatment in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the BM@@ D at all times in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment .
over 24 months , the treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment ( BM@@ D ) by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual dose of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior compared to once weekly dosage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the normal average normal value when recording into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influences was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sible at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of cit@@ ric acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ ed independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the quick res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of cit@@ ric acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of the metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min for 64 patients in the mean ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice .
since there is limited data available for severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was measured by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point were present .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ ting effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ity in dos@@ ages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg due to degra@@ ded serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions prior to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is disclosed that could affect the current safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone has been reached ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . • E@@ MEA request .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a member of a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone disease of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus again giving the bone strength .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you use Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are using / applying other medicines or have recently taken / used it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drinks , you are worried that , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls you are considering finishing treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle aches or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse events are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one for two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients need to be supplied with sufficient fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the fast sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic regi@@ men can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ compli@@ a is also used for diet and exercise for adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
in addition , there were four studies of more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive plac@@ ebo for the setting of smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this area of application .
the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with simultaneous use of A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HIV infection ) , th@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

in addition to diet and movement for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , they also have one or more risk factors n@@ g , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it can also occur in patients who do not have any apparent risks in addition to obesity . depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ ebo ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG With the evaluation of side effects the following frequencies are basically laid :

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse events that were not observed in clinical studies but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic field were considered to be relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over an extended period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

a Sum@@ mary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mono@@ therapies ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ etic medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ amin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ amin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the addition of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving additional plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ the@@ tics ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued authorisation to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , but this did not result in an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted by the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been submitted .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but arran@@ ging doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison media .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison media .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment will be canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies evaluating interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; commonly &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on respectively .
since its launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with reference medi@@ co .
in the Pro@@ Active trial lasting over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were treated , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison media .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficiently adjusted with insulin despite three months of optimization , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics , which was laid out in 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plas@@ tic@@ is@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced values were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
following oral application of radioactive marker Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the Fä@@ ld ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral irri@@ gation of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded with repeated plasma volume aug@@ mentation with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ es .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting from the gest@@ ation decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison media .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison media .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , this has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to target its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ c@@ tose in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid or given by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sile ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow any particular hazard to humans .
it is recommended that after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle from the fridge , it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ cul@@ ated in accordance with the manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
an effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must first be taken up , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic patients and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients , which underwent major surgical procedures , showed that an intraven@@ ous intra@@ ocular hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) decreased mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of action is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

remove the sealing cap with a medical swa@@ b • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • tigh@@ ten the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( figure A ) • Remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • Take a couple of times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upward , turn the cartridge at a click in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows upwards , press the press button in the right position ( Figure C ) • Now you have to stream a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Set the closing cap back to the production pen so that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Figure D ) • Check if the press button is pressed completely .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the sealing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves to the outside while you rotate the closing cap • The scale under the pus@@ h@@ button ( pus@@ h@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Select the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button • add the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it down until the push button is down and you feel a resistance . then take off the cap and put it back so that the 0 of the fe@@ e@@ ders is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during the injection • Pre@@ vent the button after the injection until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be incorrect • You cannot set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual balance scale to estimate how much insulin is left but you can not use it to set or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; gem@@ stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
patient sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur during the first months of treatment ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic have other medicines to prevent sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment .
the drug is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do@@ ster@@ oids ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 26@@ 2 ) patients had taken Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , nausea , and abnormal liver disease ) .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also contain a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to plaque buil@@ du@@ p ( including a medical history known or currently present and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum resin aspir@@ ation is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ ail@@ ant medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the course of the treatment , because the lowering of serum har@@ n@@ hol@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els can initially mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ drome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ otherapy treatment and in the course of the course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ist did not carry out any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ite mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the Met@@ aboli@@ zation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the con@@ current administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without requiring a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other active ingredient .
in a study of subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC had a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies are not attributable to the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses at all or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness of the body , skin irrit@@ ation , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein uria , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as below ) , conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum gum levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum carcin@@ omas at the beginning of the course of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX survey showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum pole level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum carcin@@ omas &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid levels in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum gum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the start of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum constitu@@ ency levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment for a gi@@ ra@@ cker ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out nodes up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum concentration levels if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ lab@@ elled F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found to be an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe ni@@ p@@ tic function .
12 Li@@ ver Dys@@ function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) Li@@ ver function , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tumours ( transition cellular pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with about 11 times the exposure in humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were about 4 @-@ fold of the human@@ istic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which coinci@@ ded with a decrease in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and with ex@@ positions around the 13 @-@ fold of the human@@ istic exposure did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company filed data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE with regard to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic kno@@ bs .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used in case of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after placing the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie ahead of the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ uses , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty , can only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or worse heart@@ burn , and seek medical consultation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking symptoms following an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicates whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients with a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive in the planning of therapy for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients need to be advised that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical studies was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports originate from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , decreases in serum cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ grid of an oral over@@ dose can occur with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was eliminated within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance sur@@ passed not 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

separation The average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % when radio@@ activity was administered to healthy volunteers , 4 days after 4 days .
characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is rapidly eliminated by the urine .
although no clinical data are available , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function a somewhat increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should be able to prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the systemic exposure measured as tal@@ low , with both form@@ ulations , was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ting under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure during the immediate after@@ treatment phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low clearing , an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ ation Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
for the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
recommended Dos@@ age - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ ate therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ ages can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ ate therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily intake in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - The conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f If a transplan@@ t receiver is converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to an once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are killed on Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with an an@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal cancer , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum carcin@@ omas , a calculation of the cre@@ atine process and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ control inspections .
it is recommended to carry out frequent inspections of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood Tal@@ mirrors should also be checked after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age Adju@@ st@@ ment , Chan@@ ges in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the ady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood level in the blood exceeds 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal mirrors are usually in the blood of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml in the first time after liver transplantation and for 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml transplan@@ ted patients .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
the sei@@ z@@ ure of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during a treatment with an Adv@@ oc@@ ate ( see Section 4.5 ) for possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may under such conditions be subject to considerable variations .
in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f could be observed as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption have particular caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction has been achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the macro@@ li@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduces the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid @-@ Con@@ c@@ tiv@@ a and thus increases the hormone exposure , it is especially careful to take precau@@ tionary measures to make decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ inity of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s basic disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / thousand ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / thousand ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / thousand ) .

cases of BK virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors were reported in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ depend@@ ant in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to have either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans was 21.@@ 7 % compared to 3@@ 8.0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who simultaneously undergo a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which received a random@@ ised method tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the desired level of tal@@ low from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed an acute survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were converted from pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent inspections of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application will depend on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , em@@ power@@ ing it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ oc@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood counts with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ oc@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG permission for the placing of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
the dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the degree of sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ aging events factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections administered .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 Pre@@ vention Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kil@@ ogram of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed .
the dosing speed should be directed to the patient &apos;s finding , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in the case of pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 active days and am@@ nes@@ ia of well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tr@@ i ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the majority of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained over the entire period , and both the factor VI@@ II and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE revealed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody reflection against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated , indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated from the presence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reports over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and speeds up the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( bas@@ eline value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits of risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ itated a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the Company withdraw@@ s its application for Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s placing on the marketing of Li @-@ Frau@@ d Cancer .
usually , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to have a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene present in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ d cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ d @-@ Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the responses of the company to the questions he had asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ d tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergies to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be reli@@ ed on the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients presented their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , except for the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients reported that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze received 4@@ 6,@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under a@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to for@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ an impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval to the SP Europe company for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without dis@@ member@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have expi@@ red .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term care may reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ g@@ id , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gen@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ junc@@ tiv@@ a that can be used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as an ab@@ err@@ ent r@@ hin@@ ologic drug ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , lac@@ tose , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed about the treatment of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be replaced at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n have been observed in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with plac@@ ebo , no matter whether it was taken by either Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in @-@ vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies resulted in however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that can result in impair@@ ment of traffic efficiency or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult micro@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , preventive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ illary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of flu@@ idity , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess than plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher based on the overall score for the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ groups according to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of an individual dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was used for exposure to intraven@@ ous aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not detect any particular danger to humans .
the combination did not have greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .

the effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squ@@ ad , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the scores of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the scores after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us was 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed at their re@@ appearance .
in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can result in impair@@ ment of traffic efficiency or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) .
this includes the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of flu@@ idity , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar in different forms and can be recru@@ ited in a simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the stimulus rate of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in @-@ vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ed@@ and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n show no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not detect any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of a infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher distance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was indicated .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ om@@ otor system .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of life in the Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis quality of life , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ sed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , hypo@@ c@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with recommended doses of those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ let bottles with child @-@ proof polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) were applied .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was indicated .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess than plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets are put in the mouth once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and taken from the dose of the enam@@ el tablet without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Si@@ rup@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for engaging the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically

the spread of this poorly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tables support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to those of the plac@@ ebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively depend on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as shown on the basis of the overall quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

June 2008 announced Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company withdraw@@ s its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s placing on the prevention of the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak appears when a new trunk of the influ@@ enza virus emerges , which can easily be spread from man to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system detects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus present in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with the influ@@ enza virus of this ancest@@ or .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , has been puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this did not extend the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor in charge .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking it , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ er@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without a rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medication , enhanced with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load changes after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors responded very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ viral load increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r A@@ gener@@ ase after 16 weeks treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in over 1 out of 10 patients ) include head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who receive St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down as well as ag@@ ron@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase when used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of au@@ gen@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than one of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of au@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on in@@ convenience and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver ev@@ ils with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of a simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity based on the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ id content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many patients had other diseases where medication was necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medium with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ dynam@@ ite mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were administered twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % Hum@@ ili@@ ated when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the con@@ current administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase income are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in might lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is required as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance must be carried out as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the con@@ current administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin caused a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ sh@@ ab@@ u@@ tin , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
the simultaneous use of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without con@@ current application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions , if used together with au@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advised that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ag@@ gra@@ vation as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and reinforce the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as an aspir@@ ation .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirrors , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with con@@ current administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while simultaneously using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the am@@ on@@ avi@@ rus dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with con@@ current administration of au@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in breast milk in humans .
a retro@@ spective study of gra@@ ceful rats that was given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from em@@ itting to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight in the after@@ math of the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely led to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ ot@@ omy fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ untreated patients who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ e@@ acken ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) were present in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections may develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed under single A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment ; an exception were enh@@ ancements of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which occurred in patients who received an A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the correlation between the activity of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study showed a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being prot@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / M / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on fossil fuels and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced suscep@@ ti@@ bility to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ adjusted average variation of the bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ ti@@ sing threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was taken three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; au@@ gen@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing treatment with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosage interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily pren@@ atal exposition as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without con@@ current administration of kni@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals used h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ os@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mice lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during administration nor after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that point to delayed development .
24 If as@@ sh@@ ini@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of a@@ est@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or mild liver function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug addic@@ ts , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the con@@ current administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance must be carried out as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ sh@@ ab@@ u@@ tin , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a retro@@ spective study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from em@@ itting to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; au@@ gen@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing treatment with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosage interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , mice lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the Met@@ aboli@@ zation passages are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years and older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take into account was not documented in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients or with PI previously treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than one of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution for taking it ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendations for the con@@ current application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution can be given to take in and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking in small children and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and lead to severe side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking into account may not be applied during pregnancy as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in breast milk in humans .
a retro@@ spective study of pregnant rats , which was given by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
premature termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; au@@ gen@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing treatment with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large number of vol@@ ts as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin areas so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated six weeks long and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo performed either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . in the case of treating war@@ ts in the genital area , the total conversion rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with the plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete conversion rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is to continue until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al@@ area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment sequence described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
these patients should take a balance between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should take a balance between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
in other studies , where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision were observed .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in higher than recommended doses is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed under appropriate use , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream directly following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external cow@@ ards in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ area there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine creme has shown lower efficacy in this patient group with regard to the elimination of the genital war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with im@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions atro@@ phy after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment pause of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
there are very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , so such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine .
if the local skin reactions of the patient cause serious discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acute l@@ esi@@ ons reported a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although it is not possible to quanti@@ fy serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) after one @-@ off , non @-@ recur@@ rent topical application , no recommendation can be obtained during lac@@ tation .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treating the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse effects , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) .
the adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine it is common to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ mation / fl@@ are ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , it is very common to severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe shr@@ ink@@ age and evap@@ oration ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies of the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the inad@@ vert@@ ent oral inclusion of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy was significantly superior to a complete recovery of the genital war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od , the patients healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .

the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external cow@@ ards , ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ ose and super@@ ficial cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and aged 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75@@ mg , 6 p@@ ou@@ ches ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , indicating an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the point of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk to humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors entered the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review and update all new information that may be known and updated whenever necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transport al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that almost all Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before beginning of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be weigh@@ ed with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduce the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion should be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion rate can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ takes of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table according to the following abund@@ ances : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ unconditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory rest and facial e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Inter@@ action associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which was reported during a Phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic conversion occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a slower progression in patients under 5 years of age ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies that could be detected by radi@@ immun@@ op@@ aci@@ al ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it was never released .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters there was a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes most likely via man@@ se @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( F@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to pay for the plac@@ ebo group , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study reached a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients treated clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal fe@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , range of motion of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , overall improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted , mainly investigating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with the heavy tra@@ verse form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ an levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a growth in size ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow @-@ up ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form of reference only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage intake with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in unique gifts , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow any particular hazard to humans .
since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines other than the ones listed below .

the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market has to finish the following program within the given time , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this Register will provide longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural pro@@ gre@@ dient of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts , or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken drugs including non @-@ prescription drugs .
the concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory rest and facial e@@ dem@@ a .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ dening • High pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion body

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medication against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • More advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer who does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and obtain inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to admini@@ ster in cancer cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy to treat their disease , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medication against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survive an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta showed an average survival rate of 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta compared with the comparing treatment .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the required dosage volume is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma , except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with prec@@ ari@@ ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma , except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gabe as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood count should be created before each administration , including the differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation , patients need to be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose conduc@@ ti@@ os an ug@@ ly toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years old or above compared to patients at the age of 65 there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a h@@ ep@@ atic function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin point value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et count has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ew , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous courses of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ atri@@ al toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be reli@@ ed on to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ cal ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients experiencing these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered .
5 Major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly har@@ dening of the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the conservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ cal ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can lead to reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage should be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - re @-@ an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice concerning the lock preservation .
it is not known if tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed to the breast milk passes over and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
adverse events Frequ@@ ency indications : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontaneous reports ) .
* Reg@@ arding National Cancer Institute C@@ TC Version 2 for any degree of toxic@@ ity excluded the event called &quot; cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &quot; * * which was derived from the term &quot; kidneys / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Be@@ ited at National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) shall be reported taste disorder and hair loss only as Grade 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was set with respect to the inclusion of all events in which the consul@@ ate doctor considered a connection with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .

the clin@@ ically relevant clinical toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the 3 P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , with the exception of neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of c@@ oli@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fusion , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
in clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed mono@@ therapies or in combination with other chemotherapy are reported ( see section 4.4 ) .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important , acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed works as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ am@@ ia @-@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ tin @-@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind , Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin have had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ months survival compared to patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the L@@ uni @-@ breast color@@ ec@@ tal arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in improvement of lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months for patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ dis@@ kl@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately controlled , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for p@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 31.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ regulatory limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28@@ ,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , making about a quarter of the fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received an average of 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg for taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , stu@@ dy@@ mus , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , drain o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
July 2007 the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is absorbed only minim@@ ally , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich diet or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic need to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years remained in the normal range of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin up@@ take ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a one @-@ time A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one dose , a marginal decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects found after the roll@@ out of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
file It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to con@@ vol@@ utions with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage there were either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dosage of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations in humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ mat@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .

in clinical studies it was deduc@@ ed that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight relative to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their original weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
average LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , the metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study of obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ption , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ear@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to the cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified with approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not cause any particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as at this time you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a reduced @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep it out of reach of children . • Do not store anywhere after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should intake per day .
follow the below tables below . • Recommen@@ ded fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should intake with each meal .
the amount of information that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously .
34 . this reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily burn up to 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
at chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) .
at chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi across the European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids previously given prior to chemotherapy .
because pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute im@@ le@@ us after injection should be monitored closely after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required with simultaneous use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the con@@ current administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , p@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with al@@ op@@ la@@ sty , headache ( 9 % ) and aut@@ op@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar abund@@ ances of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations to observe .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies were not carried out because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 bi@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.2 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.2 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron who were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical studies of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intra@@ ocular Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average time @-@ medi@@ al half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous doses of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to 3 consecutive days after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron &apos;s metabolism .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was taken from about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique IV stu@@ n injection in healthy patients , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there were indications that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose accounted for about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al gland ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the announc@@ ing of the marketing authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to stimulate the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s manufacturer used data to demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients were able to respond to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken ( i.e. no symptoms of the virus in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
in addition , concerns have been raised that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected la@@ in@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin diseases , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect associated with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is irrit@@ ation at the point of application .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ in@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation caused by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary untreated wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effects of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area have not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved by humans after topical use on damaged skin or infected surface wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the point of stroke , which concerned approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic D@@ eri@@ v@@ at of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on pe@@ eled skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken during the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to the human being after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were indications of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro studies on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats were determined in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( correspon@@ dingly to ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ ani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ ani is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ ani should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan , consisting of two doses , can be put to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ ani or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ ani contains the same components as the Twin V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ inated vaccine for Twin@@ rix since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ ani and Twin@@ rix contain adults identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ ani .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ ani performed at between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last inj@@ ections for the development of protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ ani was similar to six and a 12 month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ ani ( observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ ani may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ ani in the whole
the Standardi@@ zation Plan for Pri@@ mary dimm@@ ing with Ambi@@ ani consists of two imm@@ uni@@ zations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is requested for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ arian vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after basic dimm@@ ing , so that in these cases the administration of other vacc@@ inations may be necessary .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ ani can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it can come to ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ ast , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ based vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ ani were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 imm@@ uni@@ zations in the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ ani was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per V@@ acc@@ dose Ambi@@ ani , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ ani in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared with 3@@ 9.2 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the patients who had given Ambi@@ ani had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of match was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ ani , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ani , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ ani or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , the rate for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % was one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ rate rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ani and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable were the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ ani .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the imm@@ uni@@ zations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ ani or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ ani in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ologic reaction observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ ani was given at the same time with the booster dose of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ ast , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ rate conver@@ sions similar to the previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ ding to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC amended , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in water contaminated by waste water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require hosp@@ ital@@ isation .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ani cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B before the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ ani or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred in your child for a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ani .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ ani is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child is undergoing a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ ani can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child may take / interfere with other medicines ( including those that you can get without en@@ cap@@ itali@@ zation ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has given or has given birth to immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or it is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given with Ambi@@ ani at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ ani should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ ani will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ ani Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A very common case ( more than 1 case per 10 in@@ ted cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ te@@ ousness • Rei@@ z@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ A frequent case ( up to 1 case per 10 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • High temperature ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
further adverse events reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ oc@@ ulated doses ) are :
these include spati@@ ally limited or extended failures , which can be it@@ ching or can be ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ ani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has become known for placing the first authorization on the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ani remains positive .
however , because Ambi@@ ani was only placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited because of the low patient exposition .
Am@@ mon@@ ola can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ola is - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach in the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ ola could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ eed can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavor loss , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ oline in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information on this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzymes has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ b@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ mac@@ y@@ las@@ e .
ar@@ gin@@ ine must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day with ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk for the gen@@ esis of oph@@ thal@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ or@@ alization .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
for example , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought to produce a sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate taken for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is set at an early stage and treatment is immediately commen@@ ced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by means of h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ b@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ oc@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which have recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible also in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism , and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycl@@ ine disturbances or h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable on the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting without phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma cruci@@ ble on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys within 24 hours .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swal@@ low nor swal@@ low the tablets , or a gastro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al probe ) .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ b@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ mac@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it occurred to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
for example , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , a sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
according to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the period of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains a small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium bi@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , negligence , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , abnormal skin smell , rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events are considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the container and the container according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
they should be distributed over the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ us ( hose that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Remove a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container .
an@@ ox@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress rise &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a certain gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - was as effective as the conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients with PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in regards to all indicators as well as He@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
an@@ ox@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ quit@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued authorisation to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ aging inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if there is a PCI operation in the patient further , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a joint of 0,5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals need to be carefully mixed before use and the dose of the bol@@ us dosage should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function limitation ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) ( whether treated with Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din versus ACS ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , an@@ ox@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the intraven@@ ous injection of un@@ ques@@ tioning he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ ologically administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur under Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can cause bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the pre @-@ treatment level .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ quit@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ ti@@ y parameters in each case are regularly checked .
animal experimental studies are insufficient in regards to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ ques@@ tioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there was more frequent incidence of adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ Vali@@ date plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point of punc@@ ture , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on adverse events is based on the data of a clinical study conducted with Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there was more frequent incidence of adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ Vali@@ dation is immediate and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ quit@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and in the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ ologically in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was unable to in@@ duce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din exhibits a dose @-@ dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery was increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients that required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( prior to angi@@ ography or before PCI ) were presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four triple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing sub@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that as a pep@@ tide , Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din appears as a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in his amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolic rate resulting from the cle@@ av@@ age of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N terminal sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow any particular hazard to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 times of the clinical steady state plasma concentration ) was restricted to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects following long @-@ term physiological stress as a reaction to non @-@ hom@@ ec@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure to those in clinical use , even with a much higher dosage .

angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose pi@@ erc@@ ing bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle of angi@@ ox and gently wa@@ ved until everything completely dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 ml are taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ oid .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ br@@ ite .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued authorisation to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced glucose hal@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin must be reduced in patients with a reduction of liver function .
any change of the active power , the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may change the need for insulin .
3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from one patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
to the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia belong oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic medication such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ine and reserves , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c equivalent regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ ually and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin swal@@ low enters into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is absorbed into oral application .
listed below are listed according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rop@@ hi@@ e can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( in particular skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with a stroke @-@ man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose @-@ proportional glu@@ cos@@ ic effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ic effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
it was clear from the data that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was reached in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when an@@ is@@ lu@@ li@@ sin is turned 15 minutes after the meal starts , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved just like in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
in addition to human normal insulin , 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) before the meal began ( figure 1A ) .
insulin lu@@ be for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ nutrition , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
