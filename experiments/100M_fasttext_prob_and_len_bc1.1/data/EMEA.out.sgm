<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. chaotic thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental disorder where the patients have alternate episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients responding to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for intake or the enamel tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously take other medicines, which are also broken down like Abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also known as serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recovery.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours compared with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness, with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the patient's symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for taking it (records).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms increased restless and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), nausea (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in cases of bipolar-I disruption and the prevention of a new manic episode were outweighed against the risks in the treatment of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for bilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for bilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolution, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acroceliated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a CNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies there was a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsis, polyuria, polyphagulation and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and patients with bipolar disorder due to combination of bipolar agents, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, care should be taken if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole as compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage level before the accompanying treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometry).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns caused during animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative effects on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole posted a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathic, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients with oplapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% was for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdose with Aripiprazole was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage since Aripiprazole has a high plasma rotein bandaging.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine levels and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">When applying Aripiprazole in dosages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, the nucleus caudatus and the puttest.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of respondents' response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher drop in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an opencapsulated, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, comprised 314 patients and in the primary study target 'weight gain', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and an effect effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially were not based on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 in a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement period of over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazole proved to be superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylopment of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">Average Eliminationary Time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole, with Extensive Metabolism over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'poor' metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis on pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with regard to the ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">Additionally, a cholelithiasis was found as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of monkeys after repeated oral dosing from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16- and 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the Sulphate Sulphate Sulphate Sulphate Sulphate Sulphate Sulphate concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solution.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the average Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melt tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection in patients with aggrazing and behavioural disorders, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure decrease (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolution, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acroceliated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsis, polyuria, polyphagulation and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to combination ties, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the alluvial administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers were intra-muscular (15 mg dose) and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolism, a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher concentrations of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage level before the accompanying treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intra-muscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allthough gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical studies with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107. the following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies with orally addressing Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and the incidence of treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggradation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of aggravation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed medium improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggradation, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of respondents' response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher drop in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an opencapsulated, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, comprised 314 patients and in the primary study target 'weight gain', significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially were not based on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazole proved to be superior to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole is 90% greater than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- or 5 times above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg of intramuscular complaints.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of the reproductive toxicity following IV application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbit) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety spacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">Additionally, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of monkeys after repeated oral dosing from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters of earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effects of Abraxane (in any gift or as monotherapy) were compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel remedies does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached to Grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for inconvenience and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have substantially different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of Paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neutrophils have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocytes has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas the cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane was not detected, cardiac surgeons in the indicated patient population are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In the case of diarrhoea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients with the treatment of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual emetics and sticking methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, which do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable prevention method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a spermacular treatment before the treatment, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The most common and most common adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer were reported once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dosed; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed in Table 1 are the side effects that have occurred in connection with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagony, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, aching gum, loose stool, osophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in-line case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and there was no causal correlation with these events established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimisotubules agent that promotes the maturation of microtubules from the tubula and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolmerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transocytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor area due to the albumin protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two monogamated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with pre-medication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of the patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous intravenous dose of mammal carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The paclitaxel Clearance was higher after the Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available about patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarised drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, precautions should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging inserts. • Provide clear imaging of the correct application of the product provided by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that it is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal product").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if there is no blood flow before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per Deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">As part of a major study of 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, Abseamed was compared with the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of strewn flamed streamed to those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from anaemia due to kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients were converted to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that according to the provisions of the European Union, it was proven that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces flamed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned major operating procedures requiring a large amount of blood (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose needed for the control of anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose needed for the control of the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the starting value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl are increased compared to the starting value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number is increased by ≥ 1 g / kg (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) three times a week, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the starting value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should be given to Abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor programme - so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the streamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin in erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any flamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donor program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of function, a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions should be determined and the common causes of non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxide toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocyte figures are normal, and if no other cause of an action loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow is considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit recommended in section 4.2 of the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoise-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is due to the addition of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of the anaemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit recommended in section 4.2 of the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa-administration and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be investigated prior to the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk for post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, if a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be inspected and the Ciclosporindose to be adjusted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissue, there are no indications of interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Cardiovascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoetin, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascultic events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients suffering from erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can come to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically based epoetin alfa is glycosilized and identical to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of local patients.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used for the treatment of the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with high fractures risk (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture such as the bone; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injecting into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the treatment of Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches in the three days following infusion.</seg>
<seg id="571">To treat the disease Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood is normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients with Aclasta (without other osteoporosis treatments) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most adverse events of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to citric acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion body and osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides clarification material for physicians who prescribe acetylene for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications how to apply the medicine, and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages: • Concontrast indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg of Aclasta IV infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures the administration of acetone infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the disease Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease in Paget with Aclasta a long remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice a day, at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acetone infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a Creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data about safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because there are limited clinical experiences for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the fast settling of the effect of zoledronutrid acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia develops, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of acetone (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (poor oral hygiene) should be interwoven with appropriate preventive dentistry before applying bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who require dental interventions, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of prefibrillation reported as serious side effects was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) in patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation was comparable to placebo (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney Dysfunction Zoledron Acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which were referred to as decrease of the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine levels within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium-values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently built hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of zoledronutrid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the infusion body, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area were performed, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the jaws at one treated with acetone and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a dose of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 to 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-score for the stem size ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">People aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased bone density at the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire waist by 6.0%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with acetone (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic area.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µC) analysis showed an increase of the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periods of time during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% after 12 months compared to the baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality rate was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with acetone compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the treatment in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the BMD at all times in comparison to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months, the treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to the placebo treatment (BMD) by 5.4% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual dose of Aclasta was not inferior compared to once weekly dosage of Alendronate on the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients and patients aged 30 years with radiologically confirmed, particularly light to moderately severe disease Paget of the bone (average serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the normal average normal value when recording into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid compared to taking 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influences was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responsible at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronat, at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of citric acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dosed independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life cycles t ½ a 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationary period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the quick resorption of the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of citric acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of the metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because cioledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, drug-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron Acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min for 64 patients in the mean (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the zoledron juice.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since there is limited data available for severe kidney function (Creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC) were administered 6times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure, administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with IV application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats was measured by doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and the intravenous injection point were present.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorting effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenity in dosages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg due to degraded serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not immediately used, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions prior to the application; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a member of a substance class that is called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone disease of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget Morbus, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is arranged unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus again giving the bone strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are using / applying other medicines or have recently taken / used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">A Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapies) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyamin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonyamin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of the addition of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resin showed a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain, and hypothetics (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued authorisation to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use in Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovasculular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, but this did not result in an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3-fold the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be conducted by the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients with sulfonyl resin and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving Pioglitazone as oral two-fold combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiacolidindiones, including Pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but arranging doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disorders of vision; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment will be canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies evaluating interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinaemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; commonly &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovasculular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon or Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch it has rarely been reported about congestive insufficiency in Pioglitazon, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with reference medico.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial lasting over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were treated, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferation activated Receptor-γ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Glicladal as monotherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficiently adjusted with insulin despite three months of optimization, were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics, which was laid out in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide the total plasticiserides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while under Metformin and Gliclacide reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovasculular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral application of radioactive marker Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fäld (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-Eliminationshal period of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral irrigation of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincided with repeated plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinaemia resulting from the gestation decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiacolidindions led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, this has an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to target its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularization and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 out of 268) of the patients under allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea, nausea, and abnormal liver disease).</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in prehistory there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than allopurinol, but could also contain a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to plaque buildup (including a medical history known or currently present and / or rheumatic arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum resin aspiration is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function (Creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Since there is no experience in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there are no experiences with transplant recipients, the use of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or compensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnailant medicines, acute rheumatism can occur during the course of the treatment, because the lowering of serum harnholespiegels can initially mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. with malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a storage in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies, light abnormalities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the Febuxotherapy treatment and in the course of the course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zist did not carry out any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibition can lead to a rise in theophylite mirror (an inhibition of the Metabolization of theophylline was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the concurrent administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 times daily was associated with an increase in Febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without requiring a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or the simultaneously used other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study of subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC had a medium 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies are not attributable to the side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator compared to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal correlation with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were arteriosclerotic and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Offene long-term extension studies In the open long term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The treatment-related events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to information occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses at all or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypotesthesia, conspicuous ECG, coughing, shortness of the body, skin irritation, bursitis, protein uria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase of the lymphocyte concentration in the blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction-cascade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a powerful, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for the in vitro-inhibition that lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX Study and FACT study as below), conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In each study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum gum levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 258), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum carcinomas at the beginning of the course of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX survey showed the statistically significant superiority of both ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum carcinomas &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarised for the analyses. * p &lt; 0,001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0,001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum pole level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum carcinomas &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (i.e. h).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint of 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid levels in subjects, regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum gum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the start of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum constituency levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment for a giracker).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout node, which resulted in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, there was no clinically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum concentration levels if this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid mainly arises through UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-labelled Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as further unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found to be an unchanged Febuxostat (12%), acetylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as further unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax from Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe niptic function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-classification B) Liver function, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">No significant changes were observed with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of bladder tumours (transition cellular papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with about 11 times the exposure in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific Purin metabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were about 4-fold of the humanistic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which coincided with a decrease in the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, which were approximately 4.3-fold and with expositions around the 13-fold of the humanistic exposure did not result in teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1258">If you have a rheumatic attack at the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, hypersensitivity, redness, feeling of warmth and joint swelling), wait until the stroke is cleared before starting the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be in any case, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or months, when you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe you other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a stroke or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using / applying other medicines or have recently taken / used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines that contain one of the following substances since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of immune defence) • Theophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart diseases)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on traffic and the ability to operate machines.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals, which are approved in the European Union, the company filed data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE with regard to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), tumulous abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acidic knobs.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after placing the day. • The patients should not chew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patients should not lie ahead of the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcuses, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pylorlasty, can only be given under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as osophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of osteophageal irritation such as dysphaggia, pain in swallowing or retroactive pain or new or worse heartburn, and seek medical consultation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking symptoms following an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was found, rare (after market launch) gastric and duodenalulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrose of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen predominantly contain intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicates whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonecrose of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive in the planning of therapy for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients need to be advised that they should take a dose of ADROVANCE in the next morning after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate before taking other medicines (see Section4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate in clinical studies was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecrose of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonates; most of the reports originate from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, decreases in serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood reflection regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>

<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage - The conversion from Prograf to Advagraf If a transplant receiver is converted from twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to an once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the whole daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to advant once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are killed on Advagraf, an oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with an anagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancreatic transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum carcinomas, a calculation of the creatine process and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of whole blood-tacrolimus-tallow-control inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent inspections of the tacrolimus-tallow during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the ady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood level in the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice tacrolimus dorsal mirrors are usually in the blood of 5 - 20 ng / ml in the first time after liver transplantation and for 10 - 20 ng / ml transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Section4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">The seizure of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during a treatment with an Advocate (see Section 4.5) for possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effects of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the tacrolimus blood levels may under such conditions be subject to considerable variations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, prograf could be observed as a cardiomyopathy called aqueous or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood level with simultaneous use of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see Section4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction has been achieved with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazol, as well as with the macrolithromycin and HIV protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effects of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines of tacrolimus are known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduces the Clearance of Steroid-Conctiva and thus increases the hormone exposure, it is especially careful to take precautionary measures to make decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially decrease the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies in transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of an early birth (&lt; week 37) and a hyperalkalinity of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns), i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side-effect profile of immunosuppressant is often not exactly determined because of the patient's basic disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">In the following, the side effects are listed in descending order: very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1000, ≤ 1 / thousand), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / thousand), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / thousand).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK virus associated Nephropathy and JC Virus associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumors were reported in combination with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosole protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependant inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection occurred within the first 24 weeks of the Advagraf Group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf Group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-center study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to have either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic corneal graft rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus, the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans was 21.7% compared to 38.0% in Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients treated by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplant patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-center study with oral prograf was conducted on 205 patients who simultaneously undergo a pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which received a randomised method tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the desired level of tallow from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed an acute survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus that lead to Talks between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were converted from prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application will depend on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, empowering it to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advocates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood counts with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advocates (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG permission for the placing of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the degree of severity of factor VIII deficiency, the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following hemorrhaging events factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections administered.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kilogram of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed should be directed to the patient's finding, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII oriented IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In the case of pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 active days and amnesia of well-known inhibitors, after conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-titri) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the majority of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to assess the benefits of risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitated a submission of PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the Company withdraws its application for Advexin's placing on the marketing of Li-Fraud Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breasts, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to have a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraud cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraud-Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the responses of the company to the questions he had asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraud tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergies to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be relied on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients presented their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, except for the constipation of the nose, patients reported that Aerinaze received 46,0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to forloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active ingredients or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagan impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued an approval to the SP Europe company for the transport of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without dismembering, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have expired.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term care may reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, ligid, dihydrogenotamine or other deconjunctiva that can be used peroral or nasal as an aberrent rhinologic drug (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, lactose, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data do not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be replaced at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin have been observed in clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazol was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotoric test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either Desloratadin and those treated with placebo, no matter whether it was taken by either Desloratadin alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in-vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies resulted in however no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in a dizziness that can result in impairment of traffic efficiency or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult microtion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupillary starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibiting of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of fluidity, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness than placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving ainaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher based on the overall score for the symptoms (except for nasal mucosal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient subgroups according to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose study on the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was used for exposure to intravenous aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadine can not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not have greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacogilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous cirrhosis were also rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melted tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies of approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the squad, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the scores of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria the decrease of the scores after six weeks treatment with Aerius was 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "" "" "in January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed at their reappearance.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol, alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in lightheadedness, which can result in impairment of traffic efficiency or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo reported fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study which was administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-stage clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibiting of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement values of fluidity, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis, depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of etiology, is similar in different forms and can be recruited in a simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine release is a causative factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of squads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the stimulus rate of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in-vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibitedand neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin show no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadine can not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are available which support a treatment of a infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise Desloratadin and experience a higher distance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children aged between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomalt- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-stage clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old for an antihistamine therapy received a daily dose of 1,25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which a dose of up to 20 mg was used daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which a dose of 45 mg. daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval was indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect an increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impairment of the psychomotor system.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol induced performance impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall quality of life in the Rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of squads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolizing phenotype was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminally half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no clues for clinically relevant drug-cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, hypoc- and Cmax values of Desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable with recommended doses of those of adults who received Desloratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 announced Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company withdraws its application for approval of Aflunov's placing on the prevention of the aviar H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a trunk of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic outbreak appears when a new trunk of the influenza virus emerges, which can easily be spread from man to person, because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus present in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with the influenza virus of this ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), has been purified, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This did not extend the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for taking it, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aserase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without a ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medication, enhanced with low doses of kritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load changes after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors responded very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the anti-viral load increased with Ritonavir Agenerase after 16 weeks treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who received their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenera (observed in over 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amonavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who receive St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are broken down as well as agronase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase when used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines have outweighed the risks of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have not taken any protease inhibitors have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the placing of augenase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic booster by Amprenavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amdynamavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for inserting is 14% lower than one of Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of augenase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on inconvenience and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenera must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also mediums of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver evils with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment predominate the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a concurrent administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regulated Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amonavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity based on the high propylglycoid content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many patients had other diseases where medication was necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug addicts, such as prolonged antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 medium with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also mediums of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse reactions were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amdynamite mirror and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax decreased by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were administered twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% Humiliated when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the concurrent administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine, but due to the antazidi component of didanosine it is recommended that didanosine and Agenerase income are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin might lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is required as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance must be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The concurrent administration of amprenavir and rifabutin caused a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) from Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asshabutin, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily without concurrent application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, may lead to interactions, if used together with augenase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advised that antacids are not taken at the same time as aggravation as it may result in resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants, known as inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by amonavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with Agenerase can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and reinforce the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the concurrent administration of Agenerase with kritonavir is not recommended together with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of treatment predominate the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as an aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended to stabilize the mirrors, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with concurrent administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral contraceptive Midazolam (see section 4.3), while simultaneously using parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible rise in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the amonavirus dose if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with concurrent administration of augenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances were detected in the milk lactating rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir survives in breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A retrospective study of graceful rats that was given to amprenavir from emitting to the uterus until the end of the lactation period showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight in the aftermath of the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, appeared early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another medicine used to treat HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients did not receive 1200 mg of Agenera twice a day with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsootomy fat accumulation (Stiernacken).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-untreated patients who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stieacken) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) were present in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenera twice daily along with low dosed kritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed under single Agenerase Treatment; an exception were enhancements of triglycerides and CPK values, which occurred in patients who received an Agenerase together with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein stages with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The correlation between the activity of amdynamavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, the mutations described in other kritonavir were rarely observed with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-pre-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study showed a virological failure by week 48, with 14 isolates being prototypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, V77I, V84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I54A / L / M / M / M, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance on fossil fuels and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data for assessing the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir creates a certain cross resistance to ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults (600 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dose kritonavir "geboostert."</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group with regard to the time-adjusted average variation of the baseline (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subletising threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbridled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was taken three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose kritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "unbridged" "" "augenase should be taken into account when optimizing treatment with PI pre-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax decreased by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amdynamavir, which represents the active portion, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amdynamavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosage interval, depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a substrate of CYP3A4 have to be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily prenatal exposition as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of amonavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemas lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice a day without concurrent administration of knionavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity in mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas in male animals used hepatellular adenomas in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatoscellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions atrophy after completion of the treatment with imiquimiodine.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment pause of several days can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there are currently no data on long-term recovery rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment, other appropriate forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, so the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower likelihood of response to imiquimiodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimiodine was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are very limited data on the use of imiquimiod for treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the underarms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, so such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with Imiquimiodine.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions of the patient cause serious discomfort or are very strong, the treatment can be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 acute lesions reported a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulatory properties, Imiquimiodine should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2215">The adverse events indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimiodine-treated patients with actin keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimiodine it is common to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excremation / flare (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with imiquimiodine, it is very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe shrinkage and evaporation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies of the application of imiquimiod for the treatment of actin keratosis, Alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral inclusion of 200 mg of Imiquimiod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines have been detected after the topical application of imiquimiodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy was significantly superior to a complete recovery of the genital warts in an imiquimiodine treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimiod, the patients healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimiodine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimiodine in five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimiodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimiod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimiodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and aged 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75mg, 6 pouches).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study, indicating an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of imiquimodine after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or super-specific basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors at the point of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimiodine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk to humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors entered the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with rejuvenating devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration in order to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (since its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver has been studied).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropoathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion body.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review and update all new information that may be known and updated whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to transport aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that almost all IgG antibodies against laronidase form, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to proceed cautiously due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before beginning of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be weighed with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduce the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion rate can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine, because a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intakes of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table according to the following abundances: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-unconditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occur, including bronchospasm, respiratory rest and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Interaction associated with Aldurazyme, which was reported during a Phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a Seroconic conversion occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a slower progression in patients under 5 years of age (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature withdrawal from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies that could be detected by radiimmunopacial (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it was never released.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG spike in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers there was a variable reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes most likely via manse-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to pay for the placebo group, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased proportionally to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) up to the end of the study reached a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients treated clinically significant changes for five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal feV, range in the 6-minute walk test, range of motion of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), overall improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted, mainly investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with the heavy traverse form and 4 with mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gagan levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth in size (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow-up (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe form of reference only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage regimens were performed on the GAG mirrors in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage intake with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- implicated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory rest and facial edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • Joint diseases, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • Erreddening • High pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion body</seg>

<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution was carried out under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of each patient first the number of dilution water bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medication against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body). • More advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and obtain injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, a "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, discontinued or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to administer in cancer cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy to treat their disease, Alimta was studied for the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medication against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survive an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the single administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, Alimta showed an average survival rate of 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival times during the administration of Alimta compared with the comparing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The required dosage volume is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with precarially advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the emetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-Gabe as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of Pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intra-muscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) during the week before the first Pemetremixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetry, a complete blood count should be created before each administration, including the differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose inspection must take place taking into consideration the Nadir's blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recuperation, patients need to be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose conductios an ugly toxicity or non-haematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 years old or above compared to patients at the age of 65 there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for inconvenience and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a hepatic function of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin point value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marosuppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet count has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir absolute neutrophew, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous courses of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-atrial toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be relied on to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non-steroidal antiphlogistical (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with telemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients experiencing these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetremixed treatment is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported occasionally in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversibly hardening of the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the conservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistical (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) can lead to reduced Pemetremixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage should be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regulated Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- re-antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice concerning the lock preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known if telemetrexed to the breast milk passes over and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important, acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an anti-folate with several points of attack by blocking thyme dylate synthase (DHFR) and glycamia-bonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of Thymidine and Purtin-cleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind, Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin have had a clinically meaningful advantage of median 2.8-months survival compared to patients treated with cisplatin only.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in the Luni-breast colorectal arm (212 patients) compared to the single Cispline arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted in improvement of lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>

<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normal ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years remained in the normal range of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin uptake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the gift of a one-time Amiodarone dose, a marginal decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects found after the rollout of Orlistat is not known, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">File It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to convolutions with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosage there were either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dosage of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations in humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the limating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankreatic elevations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">In clinical studies it was deduced that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with hypocaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight relative to the baseline value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their original weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (starting value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (starting value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">Average LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline: 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg Orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, the metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients with minimal systemic resorption, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactearring) and M3 (M1 according to the cleavage of the N-formyl-leucine group), were identified with approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied at 1,842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">At chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223) in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 out of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) in 24 hours after chemotherapy, compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Aloxi across the European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids previously given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute imleus after injection should be monitored closely after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required with simultaneous use of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the concurrent administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicine) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, poxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">The use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients), which at least possibly were associated with aloplasty, headache (9%) and autoppation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar abundances of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effective relations to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies were not carried out because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an alopic overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 bixorubicin and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-life 7.2 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life 7.2 hours), which was given on day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron who were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of intraocular Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average time-medial half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous intravenous doses of 0.25 mg Palonosetron were comparable to 3 consecutive days after intravenous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after an intravenous intravenous dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison with Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in Palonosetron's metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron was taken from about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique IV stun injection in healthy patients, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered adequate above the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies there were indications that palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose accounted for about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloxi is determined for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the announcing of the marketing authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal product" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino otransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormality are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to stimulate the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon's manufacturer used data to demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients were able to respond to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken (i.e. no symptoms of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: email @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been raised that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection that is associated with crusts) and small infected lainations (cracking or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin diseases, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wound, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were demonstrably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect associated with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is irritation at the point of application.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small lainations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation caused by the use of retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary untreated wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effects of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area have not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved by humans after topical use on damaged skin or infected surface wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol, the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effects on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the point of stroke, which concerned approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Derivat of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on peeled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retinapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken during the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to the human being after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinopathy in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro studies on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats-microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skewed skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were determined in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (correspondingly to ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (Version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation for placing on the market undertakes to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the use of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless you have been specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambiani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years of age, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambiani is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambiani should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan, consisting of two doses, can be put to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambiani or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambiani contains the same components as the Twin Vaccine Twin Vaccine, which has been approved since 1996 and the vaccinated vaccine for Twinrix since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambiani and Twinrix contain adults identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambiani.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambiani performed at between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injections for the development of protective anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambiani was similar to six and a 12 month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambiani (observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maternity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambiani may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambiani in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardization Plan for Primary dimming with Ambiani consists of two immunizations, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is requested for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovarian vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HV) antibody levels are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovarian vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after basic dimming, so that in these cases the administration of other vaccinations may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambiani can be injected subcutaneously, as it can come to haemorrhages after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertast, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomerisation and preservative-based vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 doses of Ambiani were administered to a total of 1027 immunizations in the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambiani was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per Vaccdose Ambiani, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambiani in 50.7% of the subjects compared with 39.2% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the patients who had given Ambiani had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3-tin combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of match was comparable per proband (i.e. over the whole vaccination cycle of 39.6% of the subjects receiving Ambiani, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maternity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambiani, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambiani or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, the rate for anti-HAV 99,1% was one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConrate rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambiani and 147 were given the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The 289 persons whose immunogenicity was valuable were the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambiani.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the immunizations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambiani or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambiani in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunologic reaction observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambiani was given at the same time with the booster dose of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertast, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and serrate conversions similar to the previous formulation for the current formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambiani cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series with 2 doses has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B before the administration of both vaccines (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambiani or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If an allergic reaction has occurred in your child for a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambiani.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give your child a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambiani is injected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood clots. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defense or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambiani can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child may take / interfere with other medicines (including those that you can get without encapitalization) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has given or has given birth to immunoglobulins (antibodies) or it is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given with Ambiani at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambiani should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambiani will not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambiani Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very common case (more than 1 case per 10 inted cans): • Pain or discomfort on the puncture or redness • Matteousness • Reizability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ A frequent case (up to 1 case per 10 inoculated doses): • swelling at the injection point • High temperature (above 38 ° C) • dizziness • Gastro-intestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further adverse events reported for days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inoculated doses) are:</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambiani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has become known for placing the first authorization on the placing on the market, the CHMP advocated that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambiani remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, because Ambiani was only placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited because of the low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonola can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage caused by high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonola is - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomy (through the stomach in the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonola could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a pseudo medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammoneed can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavor loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammonoline in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonschnaps was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information on this drug was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzymes has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of caramyl phosphatynthetase or ornibintranscarmacylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day with arginine-uccinatsynthetase deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk for the genesis of ophthalagulcera if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and demoralization.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occurs via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate in young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had been assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that is conjugated with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">For example, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be thought to produce a sodium phenyl butyrate taken for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is set at an early stage and treatment is immediately commenced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium benzoate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was the survival rate of 100%, but even in these patients it occurred with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornibintranscarpathoclase deficiency), which have recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible also in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidney, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism, and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycline disturbances or hemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable on the next morning after nocturnal fasting without phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma crucible on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow nor swallow the tablets, or a gastrostomy or nasal probe).</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of caramyl phosphatynthetase or ornibintranscarmacylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), it occurred to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">For example, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram, a sodium phenyl butyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">According to an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains a small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium biphenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are using AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you are not allowed to use AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, negligence, disorientation, memory disorders and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Anoxox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress rise" (an abnormal measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">A higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a certain gift or in connection with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was as effective as the conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients with PCI, Angiox was as effective in regards to all indicators as well as Heparin, except in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Anoxox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to biquitrudin, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued authorisation to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instable angina / non-aging infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If there is a PCI operation in the patient further, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a joint of 0,5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus-gift of angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals need to be carefully mixed before use and the dose of the bolus dosage should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function limitation (GFR 30-59 ml / min) (whether treated with BiValirudin versus ACS).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the BiValirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, anoxox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the intravenous injection of unquestioning heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• hypersensitivity to the active agent or other components or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and with dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when biologically administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the hemorrhage of arterial puncture points occur under BiValirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can cause bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and treated with BiValirudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Regulated Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with BiValirudin again reaches the pre-treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of biquitrudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemotiy parameters in each case are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are insufficient in regards to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the BiValirudin Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, there was more frequent incidence of adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under BiValirudin than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and BiValidate plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point of puncture, reduction of haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to hemorrhage, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on the data of a clinical study conducted with BiValirudin in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the BiValirudin Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, there was more frequent incidence of adverse events in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under BiValirudin than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with BiValidation is immediate and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains biquitrudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and in the anionic binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of BiValirudin to Thrombine, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombine, on its part, slowly splits the binding of BiValirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, biologically ininduced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) was unable to induce platelet aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, BiValirudin exhibits a dose-dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional Bolus of 0,5mg / kg BiValirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery was increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients that required angiography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (prior to angiography or before PCI) were presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to hemorrhage, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four triple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of BiValirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing subcutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that as a peptide, BiValirudin appears as a catabolism in his amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolic rate resulting from the cleavage of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N terminal sequence through thrombosis is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is carried out in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a scheduled half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, preclinical data does not allow any particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or can not process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to operate insulin effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin librite.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued authorisation to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose halogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin must be reduced in patients with a reduction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active power, the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may change the need for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from one patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia belong oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic medication such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethiine and reserves, the symptoms of adrenergic equivalent regulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- lingually and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin swallow enters into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in breast milk nor is absorbed into oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipodystrophie can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (in particular skeletal muscle and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with a stroke-manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisine in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose-proportional glucosic effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosic effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was clear from the data that a similar postpranal glycaemic control was reached in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisine was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">When anislulisin is turned 15 minutes after the meal starts, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved just like in human normal insulin, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">In addition to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before beginning of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B) before the meal began (figure 1A).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lube for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malnutrition, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
