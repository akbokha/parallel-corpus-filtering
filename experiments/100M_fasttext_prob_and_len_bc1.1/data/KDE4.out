the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Hand@@ book to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Setup add @-@ ons ... Open the card board tools and select the modules you want to use .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras sections . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module overview filter ( also called a folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras direction filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory can be filtered in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed webpage . as default , the display begins with the root element of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if it lies far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful coloring and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of sub @-@ level rect@@ angles are to be used ( whereby thus display errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps display algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . it is drawn frame to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will need space , which is then no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is advisable for let@@ tering and avoid@@ ance of space loss by frame always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are as square as possible . the best methods in this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the View View menu item . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ br@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an Open Source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes to report .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developers are helping each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we want to encourage you to answer the users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also edit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will you additionally use as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively close the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this allows you to do extra@@ ordinarily &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; complete by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos on the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw c@@ ams in the Help menu help .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly into &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be able to read the preview images of digi@@ BO@@ D . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam , is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is one approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be saved in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . thus filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ br@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , on the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also select to add an album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you need to click the right mouse button on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used for sorting your photos by selecting After Collection from the toolbar or View@@ ing Albums After Collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first create an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ el@@ . this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview app@@ en@@ ot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports entering keyword for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the associated thumb@@ nail . what information this is can be edited by Set@@ ting Settings ; set up . select the albums page and customize the thumb@@ nail section to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cursor leave a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are everything that has been done at &amp; digi@@ kam ; it lets you organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can reach all the features that have been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can reach all the features that have been digi@@ p@@ sed with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the digi@@ kam ; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the box ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . remember that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My data exchange quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ br@@ quot ; fold together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . in addition , the key words are re @-@ imported when digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you select with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &amp; quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail of the images and select keywords from the contex@@ tual menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords attached to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ based adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
in the search box is a small lamp the green becomes green when the search is found . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after you have been saved it appears filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when selecting Edit , the search button will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select Edit as Advanced search , the Advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search . here , more rules are available for searching . for more information , see the section The Tools for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the Search context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ b database . all rules will be added to the search group / Search group or deleted from it . each option can be linked to others using the logical operations All ... , One ... , N@@ one ... or At least ... You can also search the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : draw @-@ hand paint sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam , main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras bar .
from the preview panel , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window pane is to be seen . if you synchron@@ ize preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or shifting operations on one of the images , then they will also be executed in the other image .
another mode is better suited for sorting out quickly from a series of pictures . if you navigate from the toolbar , the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use now the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the left @-@ hand side . this simplifies it to work through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal bra@@ zing actions also work directly from the illuminated table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you have to click them and press the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom sli@@ der under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management through . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , review , document , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports the content that has a monetary or cultural value ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; Please note that you need to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you &apos;ll use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save metadata stored in &amp; digi@@ kam in the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? this includes &amp; digi@@ kam , providing them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you can now assign each photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work .
let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ ged images from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata is over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in fact composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want to share your photos with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure you are interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from far away is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical time period is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as lab@@ eling in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images in web galleries , these labels will be exported to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system , was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting the ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels by using pictures with geographic indications . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pr@@ el@@ ude with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , which should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples for this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this metadata embedded in the image . for individuals this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , wi@@ dened super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated careful and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . therefore , it is about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust , etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonably priced program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently does wonders on CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of corrupted disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in an un@@ appropri@@ ated format . after that , read the data again to check you . likewise , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store them in a clean , dark dry and protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the trouble mechanisms of hard drives : disk failure study
in short : Dis@@ ks stop the longest when operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature changes , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot notice these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware switch , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself against inevitable that leads to loss of time and money .
the most common protection against peak current is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and ends up the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets UL 14@@ 49 standards , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the fact that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as also by this one over@@ voltage can reach . some manufacturers produce over voltage prot@@ ectors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can cause the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and to shut down the system . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 € . this is only a small difference in price if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should think about getting all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs will at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you see a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought of it .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebooks and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the examination process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limitations . this means that while the technology further develops there is a natural boundary for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore don &apos;t make anyone responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the new installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you luck if the drive has not been connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation pieces : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system except that it is only sam@@ pled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scrip@@ ting r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
Them@@ es : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , usage of the internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; \ ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; size of the disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignments for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed format or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG . the Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open source format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers make D@@ NG available now and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; -@@ technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it to an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP can be used as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format can be old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on an architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archi@@ v . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these may be cut off from other programs .
use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ kam ; to get . in the Adding One Photos to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ b database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. will be displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page led@@ ges properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired one with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected download is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option new is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam so far . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you use the buttons to download all or download the selected files , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . then select the Dest@@ ination album from the list and click OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK and &amp; Over ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you must select them first and then use delete selected del@@ etes .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been deleted successfully into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; they should be downloaded carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera screen completely , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to include the date and time the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file based sub albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be automatically created .
the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % M % H : % M : % S . to do this , turn off the Date &amp; Time option . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case , or upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically once you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this sub@@ mit@@ es are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must disable this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ Based Sub@@ scription option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog box &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ding and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can click on a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are at least three ways to achieve this . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical reference ( manual ) and finally via manual input of well @-@ known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must store this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical reference .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool . it uses the pre @-@ signed coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Over ; try to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings that changed the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to select digi@@ kam ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you will set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author when it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as they the image others &amp; quot ; an@@ offer@@ enqu@@ ire ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digi@@ kam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ qu@@ ot ; if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with setting PNG @-@ compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn the de@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality , because the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the L@@ oss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , this problem will cause a minimum loss of details . this option paints the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic Color balance is used .
this setting is only used if white balance is not set . default it is a solid color balance that is based on a white card photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sharp@@ ens . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as a continuous white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results , since it shows the top lights in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast enough as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be adapted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ ising small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to compu@@ te a complete picture of the sub @-@ raw data , which comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like these should be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from a color space to translate into the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility here &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma corrections . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get to the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch the metadata to or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in picture display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / its , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
select whether &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display &amp; digi@@ kam the conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ kam ; applied if you use the option Modi@@ fications in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the Change button .
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; stop it while starting . this may accelerate the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam . .
the setting At start searching for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam , used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Over ; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions for image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rec@@ over button from the File menu or using the button Rest@@ ore the image processing re@@ manufacturing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
virtually any action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rec@@ over or Rec@@ over by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for restoring .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB file in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do so , you can edit this in the editing dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select image print in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . entire image templates can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images with the default methods and select Printer Setup from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again into the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after which you have commented , use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the Review section displays an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and coll@@ ations . it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field in gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used earlier in this section .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is further facilit@@ ating the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more stit@@ ch filters from the right hand are used , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop . suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled in Mis@@ cellaneous settings .
if you have created and created a rule and find that it should be one or that , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme appears on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired outcome .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other educational expenses are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another colour space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color fr@@ ing@@ es , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to buy my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ it@@ or is c@@ alli@@ ed on s@@ RGB . if you work as a colour space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the light intensity values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the color of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . thus , nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
add contrast : this method enhances the contrast and intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ hing of all values in between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked . so if you can lie too far from the original image areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better avoided .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it using the menu entry Col@@ ors White Balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original image again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the pixel &apos;s lumin@@ ance below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogram displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you enhance or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and re@@ charge it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , comp@@ ut@@ ational time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors Sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , ion@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a result of the creation of a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination .
the intensity controls the ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an up@@ turned color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers , especially those who are hardly photograph@@ ing landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and illumin@@ ance of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in low light conditions , you can get the revers@@ ed problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising it . all changes you perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and watch how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the image &apos;s settings . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lower for the middle notes , often called g@@ amma readings .
the three ink pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow to select manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values as inter@@ actively as in input values . for example , compression of output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else can be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dict@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you shift a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright notes , you can see that these bright sounds correspond to dark@@ er output holes and dark@@ er the associated image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line will be shown on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for it is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ting buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by observing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are shown on the right : controllers for Red , Green and Building allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me option as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from far@@ ther . far@@ brau@@ schen is made of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose diamond pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting you can save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dict@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
at the bottom you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white is always a work step with the development of digital photography , because color images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
squ@@ am@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of col@@ dness in the stems . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re @-@ development in a squ@@ am@@ at@@ one . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) squ@@ am@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mold texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional character of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture fra@@ yed with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the mold after aspect ratio before cutting .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool template you can place a template over a picture .
applying the Image Tem@@ plate menu in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digital@@ ised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the field of sharp@@ ness , which allows you to call up sharpen@@ ing with the menu entry .
but you should deal with caution because the results do not work very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is to re@@ focus the tool . you can focus it on the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ urs . under re@@ focuss@@ ing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing sli@@ ders from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . in addition , the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount reinforce the effect .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty defects are avoided in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the picture . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus achieved usually better results than blur@@ red mas@@ king .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical results also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original pixel pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen rule is affected very strongly from the distant pixels . this causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values are near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the picture quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further intensi@@ fy the image .
this is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non @-@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die may produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but leave behind unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , blur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king of a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , blur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ ters is at least as good as the blur@@ b mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the correction of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der smooth@@ ens the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool correc@@ ting error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ api@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD , a high value will generate wa@@ vy @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best corrected at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . so set this value to match the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ step@@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long runtime . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : an integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only minor , but it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend that you skip it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later loaded again .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it may take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a poor film bearing during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor rau@@ ts of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time needed by the filter per pixel and can spoil the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edge filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer get and noise or gre@@ asing appears again .
edges : checks the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak ru@@ stling or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark@@ er areas which are typically more strongly smo@@ ked . however , it also mer@@ ges shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the light density . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove diamond tips and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ tive sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesi@@ red art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local f@@ laws that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping . the texture mapping is performed with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ api@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image .
buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later rel@@ o@@ aded .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise reduction is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ SI camera was recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gran@@ ul@@ arity on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ spot allows the pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photographs , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ ot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the knob dark@@ er . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ charges it in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ angu@@ ish ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to reach the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may increase the necessary closure time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the effects of the camera are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a luminous intensity of 2 , . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
luminous , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Set@@ ting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect but fl@@ atten@@ s down the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree adju@@ sts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the distortion of the distortion of the second degree . negative values can be used to correct sound distortion and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the reverse sign of the general parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ iz@@ zes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
light : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the spher@@ ical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a t@@ int correction the effect would be evi@@ dently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ing / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ form trimm@@ ing from image editing or via the zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures of front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached at this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters set movie gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Add Film Gra@@ vel option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the sharp@@ ens .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix great silver grains of photographic emul@@ sion .
the effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film body effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the look of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smo@@ othing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ ph shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ ph is a fast tool to reproduce your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave Blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can inter@@ rupt these effects at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around one focus . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by shifting the pixel and simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this makes it natural to your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can with &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the range , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the correct orientation by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools for this can be found in the menu Trans@@ form rotating or transforming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ api@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for res@@ izing is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ api@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this purpose . any plug @-@ in for photo size can be saved as text file and can be loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put a picture together . to cut a photo you simply have to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away . this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool To cut the aspect ratio , you can indicate orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the trimm@@ ed image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to fade in , so that you can better put your pictures together . these aids are :
harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden mean : the golden mean is a division which refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers .
the golden center provides more liquid help lines if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third @-@ third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ al@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after turning a picture you will find undesi@@ rable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ form trimm@@ ing out of image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic Cro@@ pping function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a little bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve adjusted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with distortion cutting out of image processing .
the sh@@ earing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ form sciss@@ ors .
sh@@ earing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ earing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ earing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ earing , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ equ@@ es produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ earing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way of removing them is to cut the image with distortion cutting out of image processing .
&amp; Over ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to present a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in image editing can be displayed .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , more smo@@ other than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert crude format images in JPEG or TIFF with Digital Image Converter &amp; digi@@ kam ; see section Configuration for more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; s &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontally split without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . this data comes from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be considered either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Edit palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse folders by files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with the left mouse button pressed .
if the check box When C@@ ursor is enabled under the Add Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; node program .
&amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph@@ ene is newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; is )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graphs in &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . required are in detail :
the main window displays the open graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ c@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph@@ ene file outside a current &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; -@@ instance opening , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ viewer ; -@@ instance or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
during program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page should be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to define the behavior of &amp; k@@ c@@ viewer ; specify if a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ cally different layout algorithm . the entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edges overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for deriv@@ ative graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ c multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scroll through the View menu , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace your own image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scanning you will have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after selecting Import &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can set the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop read only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above .

if you select Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered with maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS trace as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to perform a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference options in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set using this dialog manually . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens up the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 in order to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ;
the tab Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all of your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform on them base operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the actions shown below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases because there is no compression of the color information . for example , this can be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor has no documentation at the moment . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look exi@@ bit to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base image gallery . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
first you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you select are then listed in the Portfolio image files , where you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to return the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep as much as possible with the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can use the button coding to start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or in all quiet a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button at the bottom .
the printer wizard allows printing several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ ash@@ ort by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information in your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or to continue using them later , you should not select the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before . more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent .
removing the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are already attached as attachments .
do not care to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG on file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL passes in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
between the pictures the temporal distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before presenting your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse &amp; photo album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in group keyword entries present .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons can be seen will be displayed . this selection method allows you to restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the image , each person has the same icon in front of their name . they can with &amp; kiss album ; however , for each person to save their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to choose which image to display for each individual . to do this , you will need to select the image @-@ view window ( in closer description ) and select the Categories Editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut .
when you enter the Find search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the Lab@@ eling or Description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not shown by Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; show photo album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; play photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry to start the photo album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo album ; try .
if you would rather like to print this manual , you can find it on the website of your photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select a range , you will only see images of that period in the preview pane . you can cancel selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; photo album ; integrated version , which you can create via the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the title and a description to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ Photo@@ album ; HTML Ex@@ ample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether to create a &amp; photo album ; export file is to be created on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without description , even without description . for example , that all images are exported by a party . note that &amp; photo album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is saved .
best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are actually all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will start . otherwise , the URL you specify should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have related all three to base folders and URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; come together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time viewing the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; photo album ; do not do this work again .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all images together and can pass this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view through the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy Man@@ ually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the Import Assistant consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and use it again automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; use the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ Album ; setup ... go to a window that allows you to customize the settings of &amp; Photo Album . in the following section of the User Manual , the different settings options are explained to you .
to the left , you will see six different symbols , with which you can access the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , to set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; nbsp ; share his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules itself .
since the modules are used by several applications with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first test new modules with the demo database before using it on your own pictures .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; nbsp ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the features with &amp; photo album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all the images that the picture preview is showing you right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is the photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set up in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category People , &amp; sz@@ lig ; will do so , so if you have selected persons to view and share it with the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window that you can browse your image database . currently , we do not have much information about your pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the picture was taken etc . you can use any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by assign@@ ing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of your photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can , by moving the names used up , can find and assign persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the symbol for sorting by date on the list .
if you have selected any comments for each image , you may want to edit all the selected images and add ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located in the upper right corner of the image .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the image you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you that it is a transitional group , a special icon is displayed .
in the contex@@ tual menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which provides you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then click on / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you have not set a filter . for example , see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , or simply try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images that you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; sz@@ lig ; images also use without you saved on your hard drive . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere , with it &amp; photo album ; you can record the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all the needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cro@@ pped are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy it again . if you would like to avoid getting rid of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those who want to make you open to others and click on Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also choose any images that your little sister may see , control and block the menu entry Any@@ thing but current view .
this allows you to set which images should be hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which will fade out all the images that you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered in order to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , everyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can extract or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those who deal with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar with looking at private pictures .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; photo album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered above the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag and drop them . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
when you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you are using the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image . to zoom out , you can zoom out with the mouse a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can zoom out The Plus key zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . using the uni@@ formity button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work on videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key are .
you can use the turn functions from the context menu to rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can pause the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , you will see a picture where characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have features on your images , these are available in your browser . so , if you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add ann@@ ot@@ ations all at once . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you display categories in the preview preview , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , your photo@@ album allows you to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database .
in case you can see a picture on the painted . to switch to the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; select On the picture paint from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu opens , so that you can choose the correct position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar in the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you enter invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then , you can correct the input errors and click Apply and reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a portion of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there is a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a level of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as you like . you can also store several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the author in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking the tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Beg@@ inning Bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... save it . a dialog appears where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 actual . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from fast preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or choose R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the tab Size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image cut to render in the input fields .
in the quality of combination you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; Adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels with included . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is sub@@ divided repeat@@ ed@@ ely and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided in 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion allows you to adjust the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on j@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams add a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene to import , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not support the complete set @-@ up of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate .
you can set the object catch of the d@@ ots to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick ann@@ ot@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements . in the section window orders you will explain how to create and save windows orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation field Standard Window Order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the Exist@@ ing window orders list shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the Remove button .
with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should pay attention to the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should pay attention to these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er at the first start ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll often have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this instruction , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . now you have a scene without objects .
the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera shows the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation zu &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when pressing the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( In@@ sert end body header ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , even if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold out the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the drill a unit below the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its properties . there are many different materials , but select slightly in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the preview you will see how the pigment now looks like .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see a color on the header and sphere in the preview , click on the Apply button and then click the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the Object tree , you have to enter the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step , since you should have understood the basic working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already have understood the ball as easy as the ground :
in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( Don &apos;t forget the input key or button Apply ) , so the sphere has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the brightness effect and reflection give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . thus the scene pixels are processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene you want to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command that has been revers@@ ed . this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Edit .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set default short@@ com@@ ings for &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a pump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump @-@ map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in its own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a particular file , just type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Settings - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can adjust the working of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when paying the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , here also the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types that the program can display can be displayed .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change here the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; - image processing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ picture ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shoot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an Open Source project . this means that the user contributes its part to reporting at least problems and possible improvements .
this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shoot , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show photo ; however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be able to speak this language .
the best start to take part in &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ shoot ; try to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ photo ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . you can also view the same page bar in the image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes than scan and save images . &amp; gu@@ inea f@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving for each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ inea l@@ ite ; with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings also contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ anes ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sh@@ ape ? en leads to a break and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option before saving must be selected a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to store images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; gu@@ inea l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the suggested name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is counted up each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; manual . the knob About starts the K@@ DE via -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; chant .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting up Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... Select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common features which are usually also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function may be &amp; z@@ b ; such :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok also has some custom command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
terms require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ in Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or just add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . to do this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default entries continuously and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure lets the script display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change noti@@ fies that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub @-@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files in the playlist , if a custom menu item can be identified . to add an entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Animation Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
and Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . additionally , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew !
usually , in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will switch the player window to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ o@@ de@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ o@@ de@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save voice files in music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ o@@ de@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ able / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
keep current pieces visible when changing the piece causes the play@@ lists to roll up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting your own fonts the otherwise gray shown section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browser . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the selected color selection for foreground and background color .
resume playing at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the playback will continue automatically with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped at the last exit .
setting up the lower @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering the plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Display option is meant for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment will display the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; browse for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the scanned and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. add or delete music files ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : create that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will later appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the Part Collection Database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation panel Dri@@ vers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the box last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current part if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send deposited pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ oc@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files brings an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more sophisticated .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if eg . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when a crash happens ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the Status Bar ( Rand@@ om mode / Rep@@ eti@@ tion / Dynamic play@@ lists ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will simply be forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for looking for help . please insert only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get pieces of music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the interface , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras &apos; Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate items , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Display . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ com@@ ings Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with your mouse and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the playlist toolbar , just next to the Add button , you can save the playlist by clicking on it .
probably you lack the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s really true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be what media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you see , we support so pretty much any memorable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in the pres@@ et will not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer will read the file , de@@ code them and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound system . activate sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . the large @-@ scale sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , Amar@@ ok crashes . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music you &apos;ve stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; track running tracks when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player @-@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , res@@ izing window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece into the queue in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click the Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the valuation for one piece by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the valuation of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term Plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the Option icon while playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Set@@ ting Tool@@ bars ... and then take the desired changes .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click Create New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio Ac@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that has the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you must now install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ d@@ &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile it without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : using no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get an error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... give audio output to the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts is not being looked after further . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tain@@ er for arts : )

the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be split into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there is now available in other parts of Amar@@ ok ; also the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section of this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . the title contains the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you do not yet run a text script , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . to do this , no running text script is necessary .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly beneath the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution according to the respective album is made . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ ted to Artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ Name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works as well as the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection once you have something to change to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
directly below the toolbar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints about using this filter in the section to the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces to the media player to transfer them to the queue . for more details , see the Media Player browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This allows the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the garbage bin@@ s ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and then it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
picking up selection - Chan@@ ges a compilation of selected album back to a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Smart playlist to open the Create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be mounted in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
below the toolbar is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick up music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and enter enter paste , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than space in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by dropping the Shift key . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert drop @-@ down files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop . as soon as you enter characters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
when you enter OR , search for entries which contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ gli@@ des : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search column , you may also look for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . to the right of it , you will find play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and random mixing .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is the menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window via the right mouse button .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , such as playback roles and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar .
the Status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current play .
you can also hide the status bar . de@@ activate the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the Edit menu in the playlist .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
the queue management has got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have put a piece into the queue , in the playlist appears a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ programmed ( the details to set up these ones later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random items during playback .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on them and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so , you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces start with an empty playlist , and you need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces in line with the dynamic mode . editing play@@ lists opens the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow continuously , the setting for upcoming tracks will be b@@ yp@@ assed and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the play@@ lists .
pieces played - this is the number of pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist by each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , Amar@@ ok will add random items from each of the selected play@@ lists .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases reached &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional audio encoding and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is possible , for example , to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog saving is displayed under which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project changes and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between save and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project opened .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what is meant to happen , as if you would have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what should happen to as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; causes to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively you can only create an image of a CD , which you can burn then some@@ time later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn at some point later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / sli@@ m@@ pling of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , thereby removing the content completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for res@@ izing the size and cutting black borders .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking of the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the Table of Cont@@ ents enables you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header line does not have any real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog for changing the key assignment for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the System Administrator ( root ) when the wizard starts .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is meant for person@@ al@@ ising and fine tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are function@@ ally identical , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the programs will give you a preference .
in this chapter we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , one can generate a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project obtained using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ string parent ) void pack@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string parent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String former ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / home / tru@@ er / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ ection for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on your computer .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that encoding these WAV files ( compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are currently supported ( These enco@@ ders need to be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or even into other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this needs to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions but it is probably not necessary to install anything itself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ mer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; wired ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can circum@@ vent the protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . note that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ ders , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most frequent . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and already has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t by l@@ ame and the title Par@@ ameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information instead of entering into the machine . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( N.@@ B. of the translator : this is the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is public on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflic@@ ted damage . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirr@@ oring server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org delivers an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only updates to the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , seek in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the encoder and hence the desired file format can be selected . at first opening are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter &quot; Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ mer . &quot;
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 .
both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something in the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at each reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as well as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only for incomplete information can be selected , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as illustrated in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB servers : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps there is more luck with the 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously running pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; ej@@ ection after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; ej@@ aculate at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &quot; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was established in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is established , as we want to pick up data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots will look a bit different from the data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data to be entered manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for the Help section in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in the Settings dialog ) , you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first unit
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the commentary box can be used for each individual commentary text , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a play and to only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; at most , this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; take a look in the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help to the encoder for more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the release CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information , go to the internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently being read to the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message is when you try to work with a co@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows to read and code parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in performance @-@ poor machines the result is unclear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queue of the encoding is . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator , you need : 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at people comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you :
one program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various file maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still going to read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any clu@@ e like it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended to be the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio creator . if you want to add or change something useful , may it . at least until after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
strange when you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid can drag .
supports both existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the item Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid is playing a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and so change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text file , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . in this section , you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu Collection at the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one in the collection manager each .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song will depend on the setting Automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu Remove from the Edit menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke lyrics .
to skip a song , select Next Song , select Next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back , select the button Pre@@ view piece , the item forecast item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete , and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always lets you sound a trumpet if you originally should play a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required translations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section that may appear so often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that default is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices which are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun signal ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , apply the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( counter @-@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key maps are mainly used to map out sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . look at the included ke@@ yp@@ ads as examples .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply use the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there are no decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards see what sounds are being played right .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have modified an instrument , the button will no longer shine green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the View channel View : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to run on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ .@@ Your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; laga . currently I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really get a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody for it . I would like to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of the AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called dock windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that only appears when information is shown in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are playing after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , one can only do this if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , and next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tru@@ sive option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically stopped by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g dur = &quot; intro@@ c &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; Every@@ thing needs to be configured by manual editing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments by K@@ DE can be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that a given back@@ end is taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ MB player ; can play cards from TV , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be ch@@ ewed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there , ports should be identified by which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , S@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any indication of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after installing the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom appears on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for the creation of graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a comp@@ iling of &amp; Ki@@ le ; needed .
latex ; : a professional sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be res@@ or@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box ; -@@ website should be established .
if questions arise , or when comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the ur@@ anti@@ le &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ ie ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to control &amp; latex ; good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
quick Setup Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( Men@@ tions ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . it can also include some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ all@@ ye &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user defined .
coding : this will set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be he@@ als ( for proper processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for latex ; for inclusion , they only have to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , L@@ etter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that any mathematical environment has not been closed .
with the automatic execution of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to line the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and most subtle ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; latex files . once a DVI file was created , click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as one element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file is j@@ umped to the corresponding section in &amp; latex ; source text has been pressed . as soon as a section in &amp; latex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding area is j@@ umped into the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick mounting : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
video Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI file is used at the same time , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast installation .
when looking at the editing tool@@ bars , the three large selection fields were to be noticed . the selection fields were developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other option is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a paragraph , an image or a different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary inputs . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this works only if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files may also be written by hand .
the last selection box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ U@@ E is used for determining the font name . it can be set up the font sizes for the main text , the fu@@ zz notes , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
by calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from bottom to hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font name . if the font size is not set at the beginning , it can also happen later in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the built @-@ in menu or the quick @-@ build button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . when using fast construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the alteration of the fonts within the environment .
the changes will be supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no limitation ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many ways to improve the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { so@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented in ital@@ ics by \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to do this , a quote , a few positions in bold and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem should be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E returns to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer has to close its window .
once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ g ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI file ; file to other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; latex ; source text was created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preferred search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . to do this only modern under Settings box has to be set up ... tools building are selected .
to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and cli@@ cked . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then inserted .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; nbsp ; in &amp; Oc@@ t. ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
should an error occur when using Quick @-@ Fast@@ ening of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file resol@@ ves the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ up predic@@ tive La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error can be used between the errors . in order to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging file and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used for fast creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
hands users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be open or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template from document ... Create .
when creating a new document from a file , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Set@@ ting General settings .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a simple way is required to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and can be carried out under the steps described above .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and highlight many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in Men@@ to@@ oling directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference that can be called over the Men@@ Ã ¼ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word . this means that in this way , when you click \ \ par with \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the Move Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jumps . this is a special type of book@@ mark within the text . the main editing jumps or the respective key individual allow the jump to the next or last jump brand . this jump brand is also highlighted so that it is automatically er@@ ased during the first entry of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent opportunities offered , were added into &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text added ; special commands for their selection are included .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text .
this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; latex ; commands with a back@@ fill spread ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) to the end .
to listen to a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit paragraph 1 paragraph .
it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lay the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview below can be lost quickly . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special orders for &amp; latex ; -@@ groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those of Edit environment .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ v@@ est clasp .
if the cursor is in front or behind the sc@@ aled clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group cl@@ amps the overview above can be lost quickly . this command only closes the last open group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a bed . for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two complete instructions for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic addition of double quotes can be set up in Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
there can also be custom settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with a subsequent line breaks off .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or to support user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ Environ@@ ments and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to allow this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above row . although this tab is not the corresponding , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the column position of the current tab@@ l@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion offers , this has been expanded into &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . there are three to need and the other two are for automatic execution . all of these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings box ... fully set .
at the beginning a new environment will be added using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input is removed and it is possible to increase the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be inserted into the selection of a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing of the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ th jump brand and the desired parameters can then be integrated .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete can be made settings to these lists . there can be different kinds lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as guar@@ dians of the general language use are selected .
command mode is not useful for completing environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the inv@@ oc@@ ation of complete dig@@ ging mode will result in a large listing with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
the command to open the environment automatically opens and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient delay can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete can be made settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of ch@@ unks that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be fully set up . as an example of an assignment list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word Compl@@ et@@ ted mode introduced over the main editing or the key @-@ key C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large guar@@ dians are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete registration for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the settings box ... and can be shut down . here , too , the threshold value for the display of the complete compensation can be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the local home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics incorporate the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ Tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to review the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the Create comp@@ iling , Implem@@ enting and Gener@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard of Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be seen in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 ; the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... This includes the following information for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with a lot of documents . included are a documentation for the packages included and one more &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete re@@ proof for &amp; tex ; and its prot@@ ease . this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; provided , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ Source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working environment environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , allowing &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .

&amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . with the command line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day you will use different signatures as for the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this will give you a lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross Remove in the toolbar .
you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button at the bottom of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your emails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the shared folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then let the current file simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file with current file and select the file to be reviewed with another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result is to have . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; loaded , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu plug@@ ins Edit . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage and add all the included plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify them .
a member can have multiple roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching for the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their own identity ) appears in bold as you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something specific happens . see for more detailed information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Manager dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipients list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such leaders will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following items :
there can be either the ann@@ ot@@ ation entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes may be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member is , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager should be given the relevant domain or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog sp@@ ans some pages that will be treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted Tags . normal Groß @-@ lower@@ case means that tags are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ ua files .
optional tags automatically rule : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , it is inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
don &apos;t include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and end tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the appropriate encoding during insertion .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for recognition of different types of files . by using the standard button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting here is altered from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program , the document can be restored by this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents , a backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or dra@@ gging / dependent views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message range is used to control the display of warnings by checking no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and source view in shared mode . in respect of the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of par@@ ser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail .
the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural Tree Configuration , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree should be automatically opened when editing and how deep when a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses loading . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears on the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ging requirements . this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gger session starts the session . close the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or end the sounds according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a Deb@@ ug@@ ging requirement has started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request has been made , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include gets er@@ ased .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; features such as car completion and node trees . your simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the Script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders include handy , toolbar cl@@ ones of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day displays . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything but element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the method method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element only .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags to describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling in tag editing dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a editing and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined . this element is an element type only .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a her@@ nia , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the tag XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; start window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the Custom button can be used to assign a short@@ cut ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / CNBP _ apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , based on the default output .
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that an entry is possible while using the action .
is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually seen as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ ling ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this is done by the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags to complete or confirm by clicking OK .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions complement the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar Set dialog using Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by clicking on all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save to the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ .2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 3.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP manual now :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 , documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and logical at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that serves for designing the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file connection lines .
a simple list of two @-@ line context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . to make an end , we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after its pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , you need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool tracks , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not written by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in day XML format . there is easier way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Definition line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adapted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Every@@ thing that is marked as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tabs with information and the toolbar .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card tra@@ ckers , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right clicking in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the edited document content , such as editing / past@@ ing / past@@ ing , editing the tags at the mouse @-@ cursor , the word under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file , if the string under the mouse @-@ cursor refers to a file .
at the top of the editor window is the editor &apos;s toolbar . currently &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of toolbar is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document then click the icon representing the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted Tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog boxes different fields .
the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , navigate , open and strip the information . in the display with tabs are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more to templates can be found in .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens with respect to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure and load this in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other tool !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and are not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is located in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while striving to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars automation is possible for almost any task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon &apos;s Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list will change each time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note that they display correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; cap@@ tion that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches to or off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scrip@@ tions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switch and switch the problem report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries forec@@ asting or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
the list of available means of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details explained .
load a project toolbar . these are stored in project files / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be added to the toolbar by Settings ... Tool@@ bars can be stored by toolbar and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
upload a &amp; DT@@ D ; , which you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by toolbar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules in this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries the switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the appropriate sub@@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar , or add or change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , because , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ne@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be enabled if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not engage .
with this option all files and folders within the folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to coup@@ ons .
this will show a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or modified using the Shift + F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when the project is opened . you can read more about project views .
the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be configured with the Options button . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be configured with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described .
up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set in the Sub@@ window profiles , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting each profile for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or Open Project from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders also behave , but the entries need to be opened and opened with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when program@@ ing . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password saved on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simple swa@@ p of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via the Tool@@ bar Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best stack@@ able using the Tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition are different . the addition of tool@@ bars is handled in the section Adding toolbar at the bottom .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , toolbar buttons or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified where actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , additional entries will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and Settings actions can be set ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a normal file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . typically , more specialized documents are ne@@ sted in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template Save as a local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop templates to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for example dra@@ gging and dropping or inser@@ ting via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files tree view , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can give head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the folder in the template overview with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set up , it would basically disable the templates in this path unless it is explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show the right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol displays the V@@ PL version of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor are visible at the same time , and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL editor . pressing F@@ 9 will enable this mode to move the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time span can be set . basically , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow ones .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the tools documentation properties . this allows editing invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change on the list is as close as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processing , by moving the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor will act as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting by pressing the button or the distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other ar@@ mature tag .
some toolbar functions such as the table wizard or the Listen Wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be tra@@ cked .
to compile succ@@ es@@ fully , you need except for &amp; k@@ de ; still the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility Mode , or@@ phan@@ ed re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later on .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or total match is checked with a vag@@ ue named my@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches with each my@@ ME that contains the template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a request point has to be terminated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes in white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in automatic selection of the correct changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ from files .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
def@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog will re@@ mark your selection and display it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be started . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use Drag and Drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare them .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any information line has a different color .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if both files differ , the default color for that is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to skip the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the group is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to the automatic merge or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go cau@@ ti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , bottom , end , end , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the Au@@ xili@@ ary window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Pa@@ ste button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl Pa@@ ste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ ride the clip@@ board content .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not retain the line ends of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start . ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered as ast@@ er@@ ated .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is then dropped .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . normally , the car returns sign , but then files with different sizes may be displayed in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is active in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before forwarding to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under Docum@@ entation to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g will be app@@ ended . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is enabled . ( this option is available in K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for the encoding , a short notice appears what the local encoding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
disable this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply gl@@ are the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is passed first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut off disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file it is passed first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the line is selected . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an accidental expression of the found text in one line . the \ \ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple sub@@ stitu@@ tions at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the other operations change only the data that the line @-@ balancing algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... simul@@ ates mer@@ ging and shows the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message box about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when the scan is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu has two functions to fold in all sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders .
when you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the coupling action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed once again about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B have not the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B according to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option new file instead of merge is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file will be processed after another . the status column shows the date when mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected happens . if the merge is completed , you should check for a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflicts column will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three folder mer@@ ging mode C will be used as the target , in the two folder mer@@ ging , B will be chosen as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries you should be in the destination folder are displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select Run Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options to execute , simulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select once again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
in the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you identify the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you may choose to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later gathering of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as accomplished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . pres@@ etting is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ ing files that would also be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set @-@ specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively brow@@ sed . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to confidence in the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered as un@@ safe , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folder mer@@ ging view stays visible while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing between directory and text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also directly merge a single file , without first having to run the folder .
this status , however , is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency by means of K@@ IO slave . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to be opened on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished as to whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change @-@ dates . therefore , the permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally it needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the contex@@ tual menu Pre@@ view into - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now called pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by getting into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who went this way or would like to go that way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor re@@ members each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , a different editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for that .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE gives you the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copy to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift Pa@@ ste ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C underneath the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed again by clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini show of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , end them or move them . this works both inside a working surface as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a working surface and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . if cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application and the entries minimize , maximize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , you can move windows within &amp; stock ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other working areas .
when this box is enabled , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this box is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this box is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty areas will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal , all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical line display , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ art ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read the newspaper a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ likes ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , it increases &amp; k@@ ills ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ likes ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection screen mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default c@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner :
move the cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you press additionally the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update will cause the CPU time needed against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ likes ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button Document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , large and small &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it &apos;s a screen lou@@ pe . you can use an area of screen to enlarge as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syn@@ drome and which each mouse click prepares pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain that arises when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means : the result may fall differently for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the smart move is enabled , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button has em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it dra@@ ins the mouse button again if no moving the mouse takes place .
this function is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , you should let the smart move off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease with sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , from mouse to mouse different . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a single click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . however , park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input .
I try to work with the smart move but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy and paste text into the clip@@ board or to execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will likely cause problems first . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it instead . mark a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this will each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when moving smart . later you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window will have to be installed . this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse is dra@@ gging . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those afflicted by the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a particular time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . thus , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is a program that lets dum@@ b users speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that is later used for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text match book . from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you can choose the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white area in the screen@@ shot ) and a continuous stream of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the course memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site vocabulary and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon that provides &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector allows you to determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text match book or in the list for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Response , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the flow memory . by selecting into the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second drop down of the edit window for text match book , you can specify whether the text match book should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed .
with the choice of text match book , the book will be saved . if you select to reject changes , the text match book will not be saved . select Before saving , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text match book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ th@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window beside the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how to put them .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected text fields will be used .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected text fields will be used .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding toolbar with buttons is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar can be moved from the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is by default located above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions .
in order to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without any restrictions .
in order to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the speech output is then possible using one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :

the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the language generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to adjust , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends in detail on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who can &apos;t talk to output text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a speech syn@@ thesizer . a speech syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; node ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also users can offer interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ applications .
speech output takes place via the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program , which uses various background music such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ;
enables the generation of language output from command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , discussions on &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ Mail@@ ing@@ list take place . you can also subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ stor@@ e. the developers can also find the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Kanal # k@@ de @-@ laden ) .
before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the program speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher .
during the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card board General will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should set up at least one speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are similar to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
if you click on the Poster Set Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the Poster pres@@ enter will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all already established speakers will appear in this list . the favorite speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not specify a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click this button to move the speaker in the list to further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; -@@ system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a j@@ unk and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use it to read text .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start &amp; drop the voice output system . click the General tab in the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; further , if the voice output box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ol@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ read is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , stop , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the ticket orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed webpage . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to read , and select Tools Text in the Main Menu . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text you want to read , and select Tools Text in the Main Menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can , for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; supports a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ No@@ tify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , a menu entry will display noti@@ fications in the settings menu of this program . the possible settings for Spo@@ tify differ depending on the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace incorrect spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News has the highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you initiate orders from the card card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be more types of filters .
string Trans@@ lator replaces parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; is supplied with predefined string translation filters , which enable the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . supplied by &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice for example on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification of &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters arranged . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in series from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for the creation of string translation filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ set . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key while clicking .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you may only enter copies .
the string reduction filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions are identical with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string reduction filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular expressions can be found in the package coll@@ ars .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter lets you send texts to a specific speaker set up on the card board , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by a female voice from k@@ mail . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text attached to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by means of the speaker &apos;s properties , which specifies the text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; the speaker is selected and the properties of the speakers set up on the card board .
if a value is entered here , the filter will apply if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which is most likely to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speakers settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request voice output services over the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; console windows . first launch kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ol@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the so @-@ called speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ form filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause an error in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string reduction filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet contained in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile , compile , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code for cad@@ enced or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , make sure that speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers work properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script split @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the script ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be further developed so that the set up of speech disks is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph mode , let it repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application delivers text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see a speaker .
if you click on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card board administrator will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter a festival .
select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival . in case of voices that are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically carried out . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them grey , the voice you choose does not leave these settings .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker ( or click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the start of the program . otherwise , after startup , only the symbol kt@@ ol@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ol@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set .
with the buttons in this row you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ol@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . expendi@@ tures of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ats ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the selected jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nonetheless greet someone who just enters the room .
a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the expenses of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read Spo@@ tify messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications . the card message noti@@ fications will appear .
if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , messages in which a sound is played will be played by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom Text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker shown in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do this , you can set the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the al@@ erts to a file . use the button Upload to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for selecting text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival uses in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; kt@@ ats ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first sentence must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as default . you can change its settings or add more set limit recognition filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker selection by selecting . switch off the selection of speakers and select text to read . check the box selection again , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then start faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function , you can then pause or cancel orders on the card card .
for these reasons , the normal set limit recognition filter is automatically set up if you run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) . note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD @-@ Fil@@ ters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal layout limit filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card list , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application .
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card board speaker ) . in other words : there are no microphone properties defined .
if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select the speaker , which is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property has preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the language attribute is when you know that a particular application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speakers , which is most likely to be deleted the following , click on the default short@@ cut button and then use the speaker most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get any traceability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , you may need an un@@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try updating or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears which says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but it doesn &apos;t show this voice at a time .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vs . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be trac@@ eable via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ Buil@@ ders such as Festival Interactive themselves offer a setting for speed on the card board for subscri@@ ber units . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML fil@@ let filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string reduction filter and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab orders it is displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered out . instead use a filter for the set limit recognition instead .

some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA during audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the speech speed but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vs / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for festivals first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics di@@ phone . for more information see .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for speech synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and the release state . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ queries the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means that the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the System Administr@@ ative Mode , click the System Administr@@ ative Mode on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button on the button ... in the dialog box set up .
by default only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
the manual can be used without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP to configure the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or disabled as required . switch off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is by default used for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org then DNS dis@@ solves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and upgrade or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ds or Her@@ o buttons in the priority list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group Calcul@@ ator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . the New Name Server dialog will be displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names described by name describes the host@@ name IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of names contains some entries , which are &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . the version of IP still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as to the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the familiar host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit ....
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , you have to set the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is enough ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never been widely distributed . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ direction .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL links , so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in case of active DSL links .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be joined by &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; R@@ ST the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the tape is not available , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index should be re @-@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape drive must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before being format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . floppy drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity proceeds &amp; k@@ dat ; proceed with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog window will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the In@@ sert Menu ...
once the scan is started , the dialog box will appear for check . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review .
when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over ...
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all files listed under Backup Files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the drop in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the em@@ bedding of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option on Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of one &apos;s system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users gain quick access to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start attempts &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . if you do not see it , and it opens rather than a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for normal users normally do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or set strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only the log lines that match the selected filter are displayed . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display all . then , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of level indicator . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog .
if you just want to display a specific process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new record lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the pop @-@ up menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a report from the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts at boot @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks at / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to boot when starting the system or switching to another run level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services , on the other hand , do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one you find .
the default run level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning zone :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would pause the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server run @-@ level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . moreover , I could also have a user @-@ run @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other pointing device is easy to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of avail@@ ables to one of the six run levels to launch it at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they extract an entry from the field of avail@@ ables system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you need to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target range of the action .
the Sor@@ ting Number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection up@@ - or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run level with insert ( using C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the Sor@@ ting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using svn : or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are launched simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end up without message if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run level to allow this manual to be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after making any changes you will need to save them . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two tabs , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it will appear the user and group properties dialog .
some map cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created where you can make individual adjustments . additional card cards appear if shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card appears in case of shadow passwords , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Unix .
this card only appears if there is space limitation ( quot@@ a ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space limitations in KB :
these parameters can be set for each file system individually . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation
the tabs group informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you will find in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user and / or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
