<seg id="1">The Website Translator can be found in the & konqueror; drop menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the point of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, bablefish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from & konqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Handbook to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setup add-ons... Open the card board tools and select the modules you want to use.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde; addons package. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that contains & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & Conqueror; on Extras sections. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module overview filter (also called a folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras direction filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory can be filtered in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed webpage. as default, the display begins with the root element of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if it lies far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful coloring and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of sub-level rectangles are to be used (whereby thus display errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps display algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always observed. it is drawn frame to indicate the nesting of entries, and this framework will need space, which is then no longer available to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is advisable for lettering and avoidance of space loss by frame always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are as square as possible. the best methods in this are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the View View menu item. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the module Picture Gallery in & konqueror; - Create a menu under Extras Image Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module picture gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to set the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slider and a rotational field to set the number of miniatures of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the File Name box in the image, specify whether the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">When displaying the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the checkbox. specify whether the original images should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can use the comment text box to specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings offers you easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Module & HTML; -Settings can be found in & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in & konqueror; View menu under the navigation pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror, where you can change browser and OS recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with specific browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses access with this browser, change browser recognition into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject the access with browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser identifier to connect to the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly into & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of librw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an Open Source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes to report.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developers are helping each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we want to encourage you to answer the users of & digikam; however, you can ask questions to other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also edit the digikam; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you & digikam; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data will be saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will you additionally use as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; considers every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durably recursively close the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this allows you to do extraordinarily & digitized; complete by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can in & edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos on the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digikam; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cams in the Help menu help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly into & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gphoto2 for communication with digital camera. gphoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfer over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to be able to read the preview images of digiBOD. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam, is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is one approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or to another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be saved in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. thus filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlibrquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, on the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly to an album. you can also select to add an album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, you need to click the right mouse button on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used for sorting your photos by selecting After Collection from the toolbar or Viewing Albums After Collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first create an album in & digikam, the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteel. this will help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview appenot; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports entering keyword for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection includes always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by recreating all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the associated thumbnail. what information this is can be edited by Setting Settings; set up. select the albums page and customize the thumbnail section to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor leave a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything that has been done at & digikam; it lets you organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can reach all the features that have been digitised; you can reach all the features that have been digipsed with & digitized. you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the digikam; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the box; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. remember that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My data exchange quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword librquot; fold together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also re-import your keywords in other programs. in addition, the key words are re-imported when digitized; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will become the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you select with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword & quot; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumbnail of the images and select keywords from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords attached to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-based adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In the search box is a small lamp the green becomes green when the search is found. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have been saved it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be done. the results will be displayed in View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When selecting Edit, the search button will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select Edit as Advanced search, the Advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search. here, more rules are available for searching. for more information, see the section The Tools for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb database. all rules will be added to the search group / Search group or deleted from it. each option can be linked to others using the logical operations All..., One..., None... or At least... You can also search the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair-algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one. by using a swellert, the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: draw-hand paint sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in & digikam, main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras bar.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview panel, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window pane is to be seen. if you synchronize preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or shifting operations on one of the images, then they will also be executed in the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for sorting out quickly from a series of pictures. if you navigate from the toolbar, the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas for comparisons. use now the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the left-hand side. this simplifies it to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal brazing actions also work directly from the illuminated table, e.g. F4 file Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you have to click them and press the & LMB; hold down. in the Preview Preview both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management through. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the process for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, review, document, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Management takes on, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports the content that has a monetary or cultural value;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; Please note that you need to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you'll use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save metadata stored in & digikam in the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? this includes & digikam, providing them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you can now assign each photo keywords, captions and a rating. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in fact composed of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to share your photos with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are sure you are interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from far away is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical time period is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text as labeling in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images in web galleries, these labels will be exported to your wishes into the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system, was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting the geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels by using pictures with geographic indications. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a prelude with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digikam, which should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples for this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change this metadata embedded in the image. for individuals this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, widened superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated careful and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. therefore, it is about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonably priced program called IsoBuster which apparently does wonders on CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of corrupted disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device on high-quality media in an unappropriated format. after that, read the data again to check you. likewise, you should read the media with a description, date & author, and then store them in a clean, dark dry and protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your stats for themselves. their manufacturer's warrants include a new disk but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the trouble mechanisms of hard drives: disk failure study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: Disks stop the longest when operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature changes, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot notice these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware switch, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself against inevitable that leads to loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against peak current is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and ends up the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets UL 1449 standards, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the fact that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as also by this one overvoltage can reach. some manufacturers produce over voltage protectors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can cause the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and to shut down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid it. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 €. this is only a small difference in price if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should think about getting all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs will at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you see a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought of it.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrf file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebooks and 46% in the workplace systems. in notebooks, the proportion of thefts is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than e.g. thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the examination process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limitations. this means that while the technology further develops there is a natural boundary for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; therefore don't make anyone responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the new installation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will hit you luck if the drive has not been connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aviation pieces: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system except that it is only sampled and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripting rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., usage of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and move it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">&\; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source; size of the disk in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignments for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed format or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG. the Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open source format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers make DNG available now and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; -technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it to an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP can be used as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format can be old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models. DCMI's activities include working on an architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera edium are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archiv. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these may be cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digikam; to get. in the Adding One Photos to an Album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Alb database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn on it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. for some cameras it may take a while. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file, photos, movies, music etc. will be displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page ledges properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired one with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download Selected. the button Selected download is grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new is available. these images have not been edited by & digikam so far. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons to download all or download the selected files, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. then select the Destination album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK and & Over; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you must select them first and then use delete selected deletes.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been deleted successfully into a & digikam; they should be downloaded carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera screen completely, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names for the photos. the filenames are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to include the date and time the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file based sub albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% M% H:% M:% S. to do this, turn off the Date & Time option. for further customization, you should read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase, or uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically once you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the camera's orientation at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, & digikam; this submites are based on the image data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must disable this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-Based Subscription option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog box & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digikam; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in length and width grading and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can click on a browser to display the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it's good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that there are at least three ways to achieve this. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical reference (manual) and finally via manual input of well-known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must store this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical reference.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with Phil Harvey ExifTool. it uses the pre-signed coordinates created by maps.google, for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Over; try to give you so much control over its operations as possible. there are many settings that changed the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to select digikam; set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you will set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author when it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as they the image others & quot; anofferenquire;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digikam database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digikam; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladquot; if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG-compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, because the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the Loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if the green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, this problem will cause a minimum loss of details. this option paints the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic Color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if white balance is not set. default it is a solid color balance that is based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the sharpens. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as a continuous white. use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results, since it shows the top lights in various roses. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast enough as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select Reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demosaising small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to compute a complete picture of the sub-raw data, which comes from the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like these should be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like the color information from a color space to translate into the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility here & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not include color mapping or gamma corrections. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile you can emulate as your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be downloaded from & digikam; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get to the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch the metadata to or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you will need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / its, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Select whether & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the trash bin, you can display & digikam the conversation; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find more details in the deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used silently through & digikam; applied if you use the option Modifications in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the Change button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen from & digikam; stop it while starting. this may accelerate the start process of & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting At start searching for new photos forces & digikam; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, & digikam; you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digikam, used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Over; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions for image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Recover button from the File menu or using the button Restore the image processing remanufacturing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Recover or Recover by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z for restoring.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB file in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want to do so, you can edit this in the editing dialog of & digikam; you can view it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select image print in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. entire image templates can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images with the default methods and select Printer Setup from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it will be displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">This allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Review section displays an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and collations. it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field in gency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used earlier in this section.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is further facilitating the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their album, date, keyword and search views is used. if additionally one or more stitch filters from the right hand are used, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop. suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be disabled in Miscellaneous settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and find that it should be one or that, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you are looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I did it mainly to & digikam; s concrete implementation adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme appears on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other educational expenses are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should one use another colour space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color fringes, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to buy my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you must calliate your monitor as sRGB assumes that your; onitor is callied on sRGB. if you work as a colour space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">You will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the light intensity values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the color of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. thus, nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Add contrast: this method enhances the contrast and intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiushing of all values in between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because a color space with 8 bits per color is worked. so if you can lie too far from the original image areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better avoided.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it using the menu entry Colors White Balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original image again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the pixel's luminance below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you enhance or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computational time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors Sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, ionization, also called Sabatier, was a result of the creation of a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the intensity applied is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an upturned color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers, especially those who are hardly photographing landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neonlight. for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and illuminance of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in low light conditions, you can get the reversed problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of raising it. all changes you perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of sliders for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph three sliders are clicked into that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the image's settings. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lower for the middle notes, often called gamma readings.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three ink pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow to select manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values as interactively as in input values. for example, compression of output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels Format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indictator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you will only see the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a curve part to the right, e.g. the bright notes, you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output holes and darker the associated image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line will be shown on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for it is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipetting buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digikam channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by observing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are shown on the right: controllers for Red, Green and Building allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the monochrome option as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from farther. farbrauschen is made of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose diamond pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting you can save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indictator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you will only see the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">At the bottom you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white is always a work step with the development of digital photography, because color images can be easily converted on the machine. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford P5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokine (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokine (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. thus, similar to the 003 Cokine (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokine (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Squamaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of coldness in the stems. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the re-development in a squamatone. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokine (tm) squamafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digikam; apply mold texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional character of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to be seen. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digikam; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture frayed with a colored line, niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the mold after aspect ratio before cutting.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any place. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; apply tool template you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">Applying the Image Template menu in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you will need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">You can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the field of sharpness, which allows you to call up sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should deal with caution because the results do not work very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is to refocus the tool. you can focus it on the menu entry Correcurs. under refocussing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softness with the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing sliders from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. in addition, the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount reinforce the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty defects are avoided in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blur mask. refocus achieved usually better results than blurred masking.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche fold. the Gauß'sche fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical results also from the source pixies, which are far from the original pixel pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß'schen rule is affected very strongly from the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values are near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the picture quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further intensify the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value non-zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die may produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Knuckles are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but leave behind unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking of a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is at least as good as the blurb mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image was made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the correction of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothens the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool correcting error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Capig project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD, a high value will generate wavy-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best corrected at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. so set this value to match the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-stepwidth da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: an integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend that you skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the background that caused by a poor film bearing during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor rauts of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time needed by the filter per pixel and can spoil the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, you may need to re-adjust the edge filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer get and noise or greasing appears again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: checks the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rustling or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically more strongly smoked. however, it also merges shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the light density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove diamond tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften softness with the menu entry Corrective softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your pictures. it is well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local flaws that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping. the texture mapping is performed with a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Capig project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise reduction is being restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700SI camera was recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie granularity on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotspot allows the pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photographs, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels, and "quot; bright Pixelot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the knob darker. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and recharges it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbour pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettieranguish; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to reach the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary closure time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise the effects of the camera are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2,. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous, Contrast, and Gamma Setting: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect but flattens down the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree adjusts the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion of the distortion of the second degree. negative values can be used to correct sound distortion and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the reverse sign of the general parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizzes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The spherical or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tint correction the effect would be evidently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the toning / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the menu Transform trimming from image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures of front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which can be reached at this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotmovie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set movie granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the Add Film Gravel option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix great silver grains of photographic emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film body effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the look of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothed).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Graph shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter Graph is a fast tool to reproduce your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave 1: splits the image into cells and makes it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Blocks 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can interrupt these effects at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurr effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels around one focus. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by shifting the pixel and simulating the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this makes it natural to your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn's copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can with & digikam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the range, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the correct orientation by mirroring or rotating. the tools for this can be found in the menu Transform rotating or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Capig algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for resizing is using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Capig project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this purpose. any plug-in for photo size can be saved as text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put a picture together. to cut a photo you simply have to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away. this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool To cut the aspect ratio, you can indicate orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the maximum possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to fade in, so that you can better put your pictures together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden mean is a division which refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid help lines if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third-third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also diverge from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equalateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">Move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transform trimming out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatic Cropping function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a little bit after rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adjusted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with distortion cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transform scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shearing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two cheques produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way of removing them is to cut the image with distortion cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Over; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to present a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in image editing can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, more smoother than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guidances in English. you can convert crude format images in JPEG or TIFF with Digital Image Converter & digikam; see section Configuration for more information on how to use modules with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in & digikam; included. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise reduction, refocus, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically split without duplicate. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally split without duplicate. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Divide horizontally. the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over 'style: displays the preview when the mouse is not in preview pane and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. this data comes from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallets files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets files that are installed by & kde can be considered either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Edit palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse folders by files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described in the palette view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">To create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with the left mouse button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box When Cursor is enabled under the Add Color button, the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode overwrite is selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a newline character if another color follows. if there are three numerical values in the clipboard, these can be added as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphene.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & node program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kcviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphic viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graphene is newly calculated and in & kcviewer; is)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or graphs in & kcviewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kcviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. required are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kcviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kcviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kcviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graphene file outside a current & kcviewer; -instance opening, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & cviewer; -instance or want to display the graph in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page should be fitted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut loading page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to define the behavior of & kcviewer; specify if a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">You can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphically different layout algorithm. the entries, as described on the web page of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edges overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for derivative graphs. it produces representations according to the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistic multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspringmodel layout for derivative graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-glitter for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; -Algorithm assigns the nodes circular to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graphene file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can & eg; the & graphviz; -Algorithms specify special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or unerified) and applies the standard algorithm for each type (dot; for directed, & neato; for derivative graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">Reading the KIPI module pictures provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scroll through the View menu, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears that you can replace your own image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scanning you will have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after selecting Import &gt; Screen photo... a window appears in which you can set the various screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, show photos of your camera shop online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and your family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you get the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module shows. for uploading you do not need any other permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillily options allow you to set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered with maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS trace as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to perform a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation and difference options in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set using this dialog manually. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens up the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and enlarge sie.Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exift tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 in order to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg;</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all of your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG image format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform on them base operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions shown below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size increases because there is no compression of the color information. for example, this can be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor has no documentation at the moment. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exibit to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a base image gallery. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed in the Portfolio image files, where you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">The video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to return the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file. keep as much as possible with the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can use the button coding to start the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or in all quiet a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows printing several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dashort by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information in your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or to continue using them later, you should not select the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can scale or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before. more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images via the button Add images. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not care to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG on file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced slide show, a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL passes in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, because otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop. you can then manually break it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures the temporal distance between the pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test it before presenting your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have annotated your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse & photo album; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in each group, so in people, places and in group keyword entries present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your pictures and videos. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons can be seen will be displayed. this selection method allows you to restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same icon in front of their name. they can with & kiss album; however, for each person to save their own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to choose which image to display for each individual. to do this, you will need to select the image-view window (in closer description) and select the Categories Editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the Find search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Labeling or Description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however, are not shown by Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photo album; if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & show photo album; and watch the fast entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & play photoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry to start the photo album; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & photo album; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would rather like to print this manual, you can find it on the website of your photoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photo album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. if you select a range, you will only see images of that period in the preview pane. you can cancel selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is in & kPhotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & photo album; integrated version, which you can create via the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description to contain the HTML file later. on kPhotoalbum; HTML Example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether to create a & photo album; export file is to be created on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without description, even without description. for example, that all images are exported by a party. note that & photo album; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is saved.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are actually all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will start. otherwise, the URL you specify should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have related all three to base folders and URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; come together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time viewing the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to go with & photo album; do not do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all images together and can pass this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view through the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy Manually to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically Copy to the .kim file copied & kPhotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu..., & kPhotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Import Assistant consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your pictures, about (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">Photoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and use it again automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & photo album; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & photo album; use the -c option. for example: photoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry Settings kPhotoAlbum; setup... go to a window that allows you to customize the settings of & Photo Album. in the following section of the User Manual, the different settings options are explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you will see six different symbols, with which you can access the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e., to set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window, you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& nbsp; share his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications with each other, it may be that the modules with & photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should first test new modules with the demo database before using it on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different whereby it may be that some modules with & photo album; not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & nbsp; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, it simulates for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the features with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kPhotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all the images that the picture preview is showing you right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kPhotoalbum has to be released; the modules also have a list of albums. here is the photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoAlbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set up in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category People, & szlig; will do so, so if you have selected persons to view and share it with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do this, start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse your image database. currently, we do not have much information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the possibility to annotate any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the picture was taken etc. you can use any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by assigning people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of your photoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can, by moving the names used up, can find and assign persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click the symbol for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments for each image, you may want to edit all the selected images and add annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located in the upper right corner of the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the image you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you that it is a transitional group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the contextual menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which provides you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then click on / off. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select images in your browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images in case you have not set a filter. for example, see here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button, or simply try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be created as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images that you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & szlig; images also use without you saved on your hard drive. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere, with it & photo album; you can record the view of & photo album; if not all the needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cropped are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & photoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy it again. if you would like to avoid getting rid of your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that in the end those who want to make you open to others and click on Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also choose any images that your little sister may see, control and block the menu entry Anything but current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set which images should be hidden in case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, which will fade out all the images that you have locked. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered in order to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on one hand, everyone who can access the file index.xml can extract or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to forbid those who deal with & photo album; not very familiar with looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & photo album; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & photo album; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered above the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag and drop them. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is displayed. all these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">When you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">In this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you are using the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image. to zoom out, you can zoom out with the mouse a rectangle. with the minus button you can zoom out The Plus key zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. using the uniformity button sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work on videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can use the turn functions from the context menu to rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can pause the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view, you will see a picture where characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have features on your images, these are available in your browser. so, if you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add annotations all at once. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen. if you display categories in the preview preview, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, your photoalbum allows you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In case you can see a picture on the painted. to switch to the painting mode of & photo album; select On the picture paint from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu opens, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar in the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you enter invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then, you can correct the input errors and click Apply and reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a portion of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and there is a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of view as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them as you like. you can also store several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, drag the author in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking the tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Beginning Bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... save it. a dialog appears where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 actual. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like, from fast preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or choose Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the tab Size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image cut to render in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality of combination you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is adaptive, non-recursive method; Adaptive because the super-sampling the neighboring pixels with included. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is subdivided repeatedely and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided in 4 sub-pixels, which are further tracked and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion allows you to adjust the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch on jittering, changes & Povray; the beams add a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -Scene to import, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler does not support the complete set-up of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendered. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you also have to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for the display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the dots to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here, you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick annotation, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements. in the section window orders you will explain how to create and save windows orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard Window Order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window orders list shows all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the button Add and Delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a card map view together with the previous view and hovering the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should pay attention to the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should pay attention to these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see & kpovmodeler at the first start; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll often have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this instruction, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu item. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The view of the scene from the point of view of the camera shows the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation zu & Povray; for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When pressing the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (Insert end body header) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, even if at the moment only as a finite finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold out the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the drill a unit below the horizon line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its properties. there are many different materials, but select slightly in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the preview you will see how the pigment now looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on the header and sphere in the preview, click on the Apply button and then click the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the Object tree, you have to enter the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step, since you should have understood the basic working of & kpovmodeler; you should already have understood the ball as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (Don't forget the input key or button Apply), so the sphere has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then select Unicoloured and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a Render method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect. thus the scene pixels are processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene you want to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command that has been reversed. this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set default shortcomings for & crpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & crpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A pump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump-map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in its own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a particular file, just type the first signs of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Settings - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can adjust the working of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be set for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not a full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common features which are usually also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function may be & zb; such:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; Amarok also has some custom command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Terms require 'Corundum' Resin LoadError error = 'Corundum' (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or just add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. to do this, the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default entries continuously and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure lets the script display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must itself. if a script is started, Amarok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange notifies that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask for more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: sub-menu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a custom menu item can be identified. to add an entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script removeAnimation MenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">And Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an exhaustion amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your listing on kde-apps, you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a certain title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collection Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, Amarok will use relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep current pieces visible when changing the piece causes the playlists to roll up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting your own fonts the otherwise gray shown section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player window and context browser. press Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1223">Resume playing at the start means that & Amarok; after program start the playback will continue automatically with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped at the last exit.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the lower-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is enabled, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not activated, the pre-set & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering the placeholders, the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Display option is meant for Xinerama users, so you can specify on which screen a multi-monitor environment will display the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included therein, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedoctop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, therefore we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files brings an error in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you are using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if eg. & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens when a crash happens). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error while writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for looking for help. please insert only one error, if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appears. how do you get pieces of music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the interface, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras' Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate items, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Display. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the shortcomings Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1269">None. yes, that's really true! not! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the actual question must be what media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEM?. as you see, we support so pretty much any memorable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It can! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which in the preset will not include MP3 decoders (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide a different sink (e.g. ossinsink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer will read the file, decode them and send the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound system. activate sound server with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">KDE 3.2.x has problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause distorted playback. read this error report. the large-scale sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, Amarok crashes. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. follow the follow-up register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (exit Amarok before!): - Download the mpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be split into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there is now available in other parts of Amarok; also the information can be viewed in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section of this subwindow displays information about the piece. the title contains the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you do not yet run a text script, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. to do this, no running text script is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly beneath the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution according to the respective album is made. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Jahr - Album - Sorted to Artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - AlbumName is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically by each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works as well as the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-record your collection once you have something to change to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. you can find hints about using this filter in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Adds the pieces to the media player to transfer them to the queue. for more details, see the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This allows the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the garbage bins... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and then it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up selection - Changes a compilation of selected album back to a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under various interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Smart playlist to open the Create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connection of & Amarok; for example your iPod with & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be mounted in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, exit & Amarok; and solve the drive integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Below the toolbar is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files will be hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick up music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and enter enter paste, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than space in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by dropping the Shift key. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert drop-down files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop. as soon as you enter characters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter for example one or two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter OR, search for entries which contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR 3. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with goose-glides: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search column, you may also look for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. for example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist. to the right of it, you will find playlists, empty playlists, and random mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is the menu. it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window via the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, such as playback roles and volume controls. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The Status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current play.</seg>

<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; causes to burn the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described above the What is the? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes files from a previous session to import into the current project. this is useful when you create files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this feature is not used. it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively you can only create an image of a CD, which you can burn then sometime later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively you can only create an image of a DVD, which you can then burn at some point later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / slimpling of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), thereby removing the content completely. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even options for resizing the size and cutting black borders.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b. if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and blocking of the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Table of Contents enables you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header line does not have any real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog for changing the key assignment for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the System Administrator (root) when the wizard starts.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is meant for personalising and fine tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & knot; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or use the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are functionally identical, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive, which of the programs will give you a preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you are using the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () void copy.dvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, one can generate a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project obtained using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, Qstring parent) void packurl (KURL url, Qstring parent) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString former) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT / home / truer / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; -Selection for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s read out and stored in mp3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many encoders that encoding these WAV files (compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are currently supported (These encoders need to be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the tracks of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) compress into the mp3 or OGG format or even into other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions but it is probably not necessary to install anything itself. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter of Welcher Kodimer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & wired; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can circumvent the protection, it is not possible to circumvent the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily handling for reading a & CD; explained to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, pics) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudio creator; with different card cards (such as encoders, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most frequent. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and already has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of youths, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of programming settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt by lame and the title Parameters of & kaudio creator must be added; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information instead of entering into the machine. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (N.B. of the translator: this is the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is public on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted damage. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirroring server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers an up-to-date list of mirror servers for online retrieval from & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, seek in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoder and hence the desired file format can be selected. at first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter "Welter Kodimer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reader real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy something in the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudio creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at each reading of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab card General Settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as well as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information can be selected, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; record found, starts immediately reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know what data the CD should get? read the section about freedb. put everything as illustrated in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB servers: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 by default, perhaps there is more luck with the 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously running pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; ejection after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; ejaculate at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 "tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was established in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is established, as we want to pick up data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots will look a bit different from the data obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data to be entered manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for the Help section in the section Questions and Answers, or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there, a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; -Settings in the Settings dialog), you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first unit</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Actual Title', unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The commentary box can be used for each individual commentary text, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a play and to only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudio creator; at most, this option is set on the encoding settings tab; take a look in the 'Basic Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help to the encoder for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the release CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information, go to the internet page of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "", "go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is currently being read to the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message is when you try to work with a coder you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows to read and code parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in performance-poor machines the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queue of the encoding is. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For successful use of & kaudio creator, you need: 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudio creator; a part of an important & kde; package is. if you read this, you probably already have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiling from source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">One program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the various file maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still going to read? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first start of the program without any clue like it should continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended to be the first version for a manual on & kaudio creator. if you want to add or change something useful, may it. at least until after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when you've managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player of & kde; besides others, it also has some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have with real-time graphics and karaoke-real-time highlighting of lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is required for GUS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid can drag.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically calculates the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. when you finish & kde; quit while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid is playing a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and so change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text file, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. in this section, you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu Collection at the point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one in the collection manager each.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it has to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song will depend on the setting Automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu Remove from the Edit menu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, select Next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back, select the button Preview piece, the item forecast item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete, and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always lets you sound a trumpet if you originally should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required translations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the keymap section that may appear so often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap... END Define keymap" Another Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that default is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices which are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun signal (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, apply the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (counter-shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is a different percussionist (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are mainly used to map out sounds on the percussions-channel. look at the included keypads as examples.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that there are no decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that gets a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards see what sounds are being played right.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have modified an instrument, the button will no longer shine green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the View channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to run on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable the setting Automatically add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default speed you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid.Your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I study mathematics at the university of Maacute; laga. currently I am in the third year, so I don't have much leisure time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies, I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really get a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, because I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anybody for it. I would like to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of the AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notifications or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also found on its homepage, which is under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile and kmid with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SMB Player; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s, or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called dock windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that only appears when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are playing after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, one can only do this if & SMB; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, and next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and altering [General Options] No Intro = 0 obtrusive option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically stopped by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end-animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; & lt; img dur = "ing dur =" ing dur = "introc" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smil</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; Everything needs to be configured by manual editing of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, like setting up the backend per mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments by KDE can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB player; can play cards from TV, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be chewed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there, ports should be identified by which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any indication of how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be done as root after installing the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom appears on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for performance?</seg>

<seg id="1741">QT;: & Qt; is a C + + library for the creation of graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a compiling of & Kile; needed.</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional scaffolding application. under Unix-like systems is likely to be resorted to the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. these enable easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the box; -website should be established.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If questions arise, or when compiling & Kile, or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for & kde; -desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and customized access to all & latex; -programs. furthermore, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; -reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the urantile & tex; difficult to use, a layie (inlay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While there is only a good view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book. to control & latex; good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Quick Setup Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard (Mentions) provides some possibilities for creating the document. it can also include some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [letter], book [report], report [scrartcl], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrallye], slides [Prosper], or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this will set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be heals (for proper processing of & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for latex; for inclusion, they only have to be balanced in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Review (DIN), Report (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (complying with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it's just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). through & Kile; if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that any mathematical environment has not been closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic execution of the settings, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically creates an empty line (for entering the text) and the associated line to line the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and most subtle):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex files. once a DVI file was created, click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are used with the editor and as soon as one element is clicked in the DVI; file is jumped to the corresponding section in & latex; source text has been pressed. as soon as a section in & latex; source text has been clicked, the corresponding area is jumped into the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick mounting: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI file is used at the same time, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after fast installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the editing toolbars, the three large selection fields were to be noticed. the selection fields were developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other option is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a paragraph, an image or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary inputs. for & bibtex; this works only if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; -files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files may also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box named GrÃ ¶ UE is used for determining the font name. it can be set up the font sizes for the main text, the fuzz notes, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">By calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from bottom to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font name. if the font size is not set at the beginning, it can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the built-in menu or the quick-build button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. when using fast construction, the eyepiece should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then allows the alteration of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will be supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no limitation (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to improve the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, bold prints, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {soh} or any other environment. a single word in a sentence can be represented in italics by\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language has been presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be performed. to do this, a quote, a few positions in bold and italics pressure and a poem should be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl E returns to the editor (in the internal viewer). an external viewer has to close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I ng). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI file; file to other formats. once the DVI file was created from the & latex; source text was created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preferred search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -bindings. to do this only modern under Settings box has to be set up... tools building are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the preferred search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and clicked. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; -viewer is then inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & nbsp; in & Oct.; set as text editor (setting up eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using Quick-Fastening of the & DVI; if an error is present, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file resolves the source of error in the source code. in the editor, the pop-up predictive LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error can be used between the errors. in order to view the erroneous line, the error must be clicked in the logging file and & Kile; jump to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used for fast creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be open or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Setting General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if a simple way is required to create a template, it should be searched for one on the Internet and can be carried out under the steps described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlight many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be done in Mentooling directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference that can be called over the MenÃ ¼ help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; -word. this means that in this way, when you click\\ par with\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the Move Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumps. this is a special type of bookmark within the text. the main editing jumps or the respective key individual allow the jump to the next or last jump brand. this jump brand is also highlighted so that it is automatically erased during the first entry of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already excellent opportunities offered, were added into & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added; special commands for their selection are included.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also includes & latex; commands with a backfill spread (\\) and an additional star (*) to the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To listen to a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key root Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for a faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit paragraph 1 paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lay the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview below can be lost quickly. this command will close the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special orders for & latex; -groups which are determined by brackets {...}. under the Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those of Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command you jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curvest clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the scaled clamp of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group clamps the overview above can be lost quickly. this command only closes the last open group so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a bed. for the practical implementation it is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple instructions." & Kile; knows this case and supports two complete instructions for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic addition of double quotes can be set up in Settings box... LaTeX to be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be custom settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and therefore German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment close & box; the current line with\\\\ associated with a subsequent line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or to support user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; Set... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -Environments and thereby all Et signs (amp;). & Kile; tries to allow this. while pressing Shift; Alt; search & Kile; after the next tab in the above row. although this tab is not the corresponding, add & Kile; some intermediate space for the column position of the current tablator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source code completion offers, this has been expanded into & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). there are three to need and the other two are for automatic execution. all of these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings box... fully set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will be added using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last character of the input is removed and it is possible to increase the complete list. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions can be inserted into the selection of a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing of the jump brand NÃ ¤th jump brand and the desired parameters can then be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete can be made settings to these lists. there can be different kinds lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as guardians of the general language use are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for completing environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the invocation of complete digging mode will result in a large listing with ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment automatically opens and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the ambient delay can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete can be made settings to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of chunks that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile can be fully set up. as an example of an assignment list, the file example.cwl, for example, is included in the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word Completted mode introduced over the main editing or the key-key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large guardians are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the complete registration for all already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the settings box... and can be shut down. here, too, the threshold value for the display of the complete compensation can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the local home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics incorporate the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -Tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To review the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped together in the Create compiling, Implementing and Generating View.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard of Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be seen in the standard viewer by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4; the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the Project New Project.... This includes the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filling the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are shipped with a lot of documents. included are a documentation for the packages included and one more & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete reproof for & tex; and its protease. this is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; provided, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk, containing a database with all to & Kile; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile; only the results will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloff and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -Source editor, which can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; working environment environment. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, allowing & Kile; also on & Mac; also available on & Mac; with installed OS-X.</seg>
<seg id="1869">Many thanks to those who want to continue the & Kile; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we can use all in respect of & GNU; license. up-to-date information on the contributors is available in MenÃ ¼ ber & Kile;.</seg>

<seg id="1874">For random signatures, any signature from the signature file of & ksig is read out. by many signatures with different quotations, styles and information, you can make your e-mails varied and unique.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For day signatures, the same signature from the signature file of & ksig is read out for the whole day. for each day you will use different signatures as for the random signatures you create unique emails.</seg>
<seg id="1876">To create a new signature, select Ctrl; N File New. this will give you a lt; empty signature; and add your new signature in the Signatures section.</seg>
<seg id="1877">You can create as many signatures as you like. then you have a list of signatures for e-mail programs like & kmail; whether you use e-mails privately or professionally, there are always enough signatures.</seg>

<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to uniquely identify them.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have multiple roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching for the team member out of the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their own identity) appears in bold as you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something specific happens. see for more detailed information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Manager dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipients list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager. see how such leaders will be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following items:</seg>
<seg id="1943">There can be either the annotation entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes may be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname of the introduced nickname of the team member is, role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject manager should be given the relevant domain or subproject names, as shown in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted Tags. normal Groß-lowercase means that tags are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tagua files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagua files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically rule: if checked, for tags that the closing tag is optional, it is inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Don't include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end tag automatically: when enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the appropriate encoding during insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for recognition of different types of files. by using the standard button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). this setting here is altered from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program, the document can be restored by this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for unsaved documents, a backup will be created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed by changing the MDI modes and / or dragging / dependent views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL and source view in shared mode. in respect of the different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the representation of parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Tree Configuration, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree should be automatically opened when editing and how deep when a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third party which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses loading. only-read-Kparts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been adjusted, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears on the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugging requirements. this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in normal cases it is not necessary to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugger session starts the session. close the connection to the debugger or end the sounds according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the view debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a Debugging requirement has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request has been made, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include gets erased.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdalp as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg which can be found on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus; to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; features such as car completion and node trees. your simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the Script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders include handy, toolbar clones of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tag XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain anything but element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the method method. specify the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element only.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags to describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in tag editing dialog and attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a editing and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each field; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined. this element is an element type only.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a hernia, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the tag XML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; start window and select TagXML. another dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple and descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the Custom button can be used to assign a shortcut; with Kone, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not restricted) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / CNBP _ apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document, file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, based on the default output.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" if available so that an entry is possible while using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as los, starte, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startling; -Tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this is done by the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags to complete or confirm by clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; functions complement the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the tool bar Set dialog using Settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by clicking on all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index top element = Section1.html Sec.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag3.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP manual now:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2, documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and logical at the top end of tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves for designing the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of two-line context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places, there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing. to make an end, we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your private GPG key after its passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, you need to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool tracks, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not written by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in day XML format. there is easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition line: the string that is in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adapted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; Everything that is marked as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; stored. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with information and the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card trackers, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right clicking in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the edited document content, such as editing / pasting / pasting, editing the tags at the mouse-cursor, the word under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file, if the string under the mouse-cursor refers to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window is the editor's toolbar. currently & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document then click the icon representing the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted Tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog boxes different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building manners (QIT;) allow you to navigate, navigate, open and strip the information. in the display with tabs are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more to templates can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project will also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands opens with respect to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load this in & quantaplus; like any other tool!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and are not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While striving to create the best & HTML editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; therefore the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars automation is possible for almost any task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & konqueror; type, or run khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon's Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list will change each time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look in the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there special characters to & HTML; -Note that they display correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; caption that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches to or off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">This is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scriptions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switch and switch the problem report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar at the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries forecasting or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">The list of available means of transport depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project files / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar, which only creates the name. actions must be added to the toolbar by Settings... Toolbars can be stored by toolbar and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Upload a & DTD;, which you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD;. is useful if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the entire & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar is denied if this day contradicts the rules in this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries the switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flash card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add or change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out best from top to bottom, because, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.ne.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be enabled if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not engage.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This will show a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or modified using the Shift + F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignor, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when the project is opened. you can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. the debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles (see in) can be set in the Subwindow profiles, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by contacting each profile for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or Open Project from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files will find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders also behave, but the entries need to be opened and opened with... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blended to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password saved on the disk -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simple swap of the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via the Toolbar Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best stackable using the Toolbar menu. usage and addition are different. the addition of toolbars is handled in the section Adding toolbar at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbar buttons or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified where actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action processed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and Settings actions can be set..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a normal file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. typically, more specialized documents are nested in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template Save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop templates to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for example dragging and dropping or inserting via the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files tree view, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented approach. you can give headlines and footer lines or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click on the folder in the template overview with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set up, it would basically disable the templates in this path unless it is explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show the right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol displays the VPL version of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes in the source text editor and the VPL editor are visible at the same time, and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL editor. pressing F9 will enable this mode to move the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Quanta. by choosing VPL; -View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the time span can be set. basically, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose the tools documentation properties. this allows editing invisible tags when working with the VPL editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change on the list is as close as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processing, by moving the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor will act as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by pressing the button or the distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other armature tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar functions such as the table wizard or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes in white signs. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in automatic selection of the correct changes. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ from files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Def3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog will remark your selection and display it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be started. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Drag and Drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; load and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare them.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any information line has a different color.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If both files differ, the default color for that is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [Change] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to skip the next resolved / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the group is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to the automatic merge or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, bottom, end, end, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auxiliary window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Paste button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Paste). if this is enabled, whatever you mark, will be automatically copied to the clipboard and manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option because you could accidentally override the clipboard content.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use car return + line feed\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not retain the line ends of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start. (set up Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered as asterated.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then dropped.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 attempts to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. even when merging white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of one line, while others only store a line feed '\'. normally, the car returns sign, but then files with different sizes may be displayed in the page-to-page comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for even smaller differences. the option is active in default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before forwarding to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white signs in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under Documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version of the suffix .orig will be appended. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is enabled. (this option is available in KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for the encoding, a short notice appears what the local encoding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (e.g. your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply glare the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is passed first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut off disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is passed first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only when the line is selected. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. each entry line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line spacing to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\ 1 / 'This. * is an accidental expression of the found text in one line. the\\ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line spacing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple substitutions at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor will be retained for displaying and merging. the other operations change only the data that the line-balancing algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... simulates merging and shows the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see further details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message box about current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu has two functions to fold in all subdirectories and fold all subdirectories with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the coupling action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed once again about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B have not the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronize dirs is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B according to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option new file instead of merge is enabled, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file will be processed after another. the status column shows the date when merging was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected happens. if the merge is completed, you should check for a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, Kdiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all connection actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the three folder merging mode C will be used as the target, in the two folder merging, B will be chosen as target and when synchronizing A and / or B will be used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries you should be in the destination folder are displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select Run Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions due to conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options to execute, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& Kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file) then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select once again start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">In the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you identify the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), & kdiff3; you may choose to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will see & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later gathering of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as accomplished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). presetting is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignoring files that would also be ignored by CVS. many auto-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set-specific to a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively browsed. (note that & kdiff3; not for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders across a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidence in the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered as identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered as unsafe, because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .original. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merging view stays visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also directly merge a single file, without first having to run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status, however, is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency by means of KIO slave. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to be opened on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished as to whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change-dates. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the Confidence of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it needs & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; then remove & diff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the contextual menu Preview into - Kdiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now called pare) are already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by getting into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or would like to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, a different editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for that.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Paste) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C underneath the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed again by clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini show of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, end them or move them. this works both inside a working surface as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; motion is possible both inside a working surface and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager. if clicked, the icon and the name of the application and the entries minimize, maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, you can move windows within & stock; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this box is enabled, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this box is enabled, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this box is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only empty areas will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its default symbol and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal, all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical line display, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button inside & Kpager; and select setting switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can not be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the key windowclearentMode and assign it a value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the mouse-cursor continues for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and each mouse click prepares pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and which each mouse click prepares pain. furthermore, it can emulate the dragging with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; avoiding pain that arises when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means: the result may fall differently for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you briefly interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is enabled, make & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button has emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is enabled. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it drains the mouse button again if no moving the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will be started. this function is currently only available at & kde. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, you should let the smart move off. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, from mouse to mouse different. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you own a single click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy and paste text into the clipboard or to execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will likely cause problems first. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; use it instead. mark a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this will each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when moving smart. later you can use the smart move without the audible click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window will have to be installed. this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse is dragging. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those afflicted by the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a particular time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button. thus, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text match book. from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot) you can choose the dictionary for word completion. & kmouth; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can reconcile the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words can be included in the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white area in the screenshot) and a continuous stream of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have kmouth, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is appended to the course memory. you can select phrases that are to be spoken again.</seg>

<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. additionally, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; ask then which dictionaries are merged, and how to put them.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option, you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. da & kmouth; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are shown as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard shortcut. if you have selected a text passage, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">You can either add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dragging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the & Alt; button.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts;. for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech-scheduler program. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace incorrect spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the" "" "speech-Dispatcher" "" "program works with a text. & ktats; distinguishes four types of texts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News has the highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read, you can with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you initiate orders from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String Translator replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktats; is supplied with predefined string translation filters, which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">XML; -reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. supplied by & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts. if you have set a female voice for example on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text assignment, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification of & ktats; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters arranged. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in series from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string translation filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erset. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key while clicking.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You will get the application ID running programs with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Copete-3432 shows you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string reduction filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions are identical with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string reduction filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular expressions can be found in the package collars.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transforms translate & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc can be reached via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The Speaker Selection filter lets you send texts to a specific speaker set up on the card board, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by a female voice from kmail. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; there is a text attached to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by means of the speaker's properties, which specifies the text on & ktats; the speaker is selected and the properties of the speakers set up on the card board.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will apply if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected, which is most likely to meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the speaker selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speakers settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker Selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, compile, you need a current KDE development environment (version 3.4 or later) including packages of kdelibs and the development files for the "speech-Dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts, from the source code for cadenced or downloaded the tarball currently created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts; first, make sure that speech synthesizers work properly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script split-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the script; the program kttmsgr will be further developed so that the set up of speech disks is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can go back to sentence or paragraph mode, let it repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application delivers text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts, you will see a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card board administrator will be displayed. for example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to Festival is included in PATH, you only need to enter a festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival. in case of voices that are & ktts; known, this setting is automatically carried out. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovakian use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display them grey, the voice you choose does not leave these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multisyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that (with bigger memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you haven't set up a speaker (or click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed in kttsmgr on the start of the program. otherwise, after startup, only the symbol ktolmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for selecting text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), as this is the default voice, the festival uses in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, the SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" http: "</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can start & ktats; faster with pre-reading, since only the first sentence must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as default. you can change its settings or add more set limit recognition filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker selection by selecting. switch off the selection of speakers and select text to read. check the box selection again, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then start faster with the pre-read, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, you can then pause or cancel orders on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit recognition filter is automatically set up if you run kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering). note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-Filters are never applied to & kde; messages (notify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal layout limit filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card list, you can overwrite the language settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the card board speaker). in other words: there are no microphone properties defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">If you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select the speaker, which is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property has precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the language attribute is when you know that a particular application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field of speakers, which is most likely to be deleted the following, click on the default shortcut button and then use the speaker most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I do not get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, you may need an uncompatible version of GStreamer. you can try updating or uninstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; a message appears which says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I loaded an extra voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but it doesn't show this voice at a time.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vs. as a guide you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be sox installed and can be traceable via the environment variable PATH. some SynthesizerBuilders such as Festival Interactive themselves offer a setting for speed on the card board for subscriber units. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion from & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML fillet filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is obvious. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male british) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vs / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for festivals first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the option code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option encoding must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -Voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone.

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloff language synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you must install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; neither pitch, volume nor speech speed can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any voice synthesizer which can be controlled from a command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the network settings, it attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and the release state. by selecting the setting non-re-queries the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, which means that the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the System Administrative Mode, click the System Administrative Mode on the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button on the button... in the dialog box set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be used without DHCP or BOOTP to configure the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled as required. switch off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is by default used for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">This is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.einedomain.org then DNS dissolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and upgrade or downgrading in the list with the Hinds or Hero buttons in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group Calculator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added. the New Name Server dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names described by name describes the hostname IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of names contains some entries, which are & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. the version of IP still in the test is intended to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add New Alias to the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the familiar host has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit....</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings module are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, you have to set the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is enough if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is enough; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely distributed. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in external networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP redirection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 has its own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL links, so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in case of active DSL links.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly reordered by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another standby than expected may occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the capability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be joined by & kdat. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; RST the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; the pre-tensioning on the tape is not available, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index should be re-created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be recognized by a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape drive must be formatted before you can be used to save data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before being formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity proceeds & kdat; proceed with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog window will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the Insert Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan is started, the dialog box will appear for check. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you confirm the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Settings dialog appears. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the Restore dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the tape index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under Backup Files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat, before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the drop in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the embedding of & kdat, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option on Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is enabled, tried & kdat; the hardware-based block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case, the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of one's system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users gain quick access to information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start attempts & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. if you do not see it, and it opens rather than a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for normal users normally do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or set strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only the log lines that match the selected filter are displayed. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display all. then, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log, so you & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of level indicator. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to display a specific process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identifier (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new record lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the pop-up menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a report from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts at boot-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks at / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to boot when starting the system or switching to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services, on the other hand, do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one you find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning zone:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by reboot the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would pause the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server run-level that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running. moreover, I could also have a user-run-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointing device is easy to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of availables to one of the six run levels to launch it at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original run level (or its position). this only happens if they extract an entry from the field of availables system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you need to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sorting Number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Available System Services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection up- or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired run level with insert (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the Sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using svn: or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are launched simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end up without message if their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the run level to allow this manual to be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making any changes you will need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two tabs, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it will appear the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is created where you can make individual adjustments. additional card cards appear if shadow passwords, for example, / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears in case of shadow passwords, for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if there is space limitation (quota) enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space limitations in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set for each file system individually. the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tabs group informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user and / or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot of the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
