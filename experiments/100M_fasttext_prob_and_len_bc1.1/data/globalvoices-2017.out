although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gar@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less journalist who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was me , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expresses it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people have re@@ acted to his statements and voted for him in crowds .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ in@@ ee candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that welcomes people from all over the world , a deep beli@@ ever man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gled for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump embark@@ ed on his way to nom@@ in@@ ating Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a support and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
categ@@ or@@ ising people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . : as much as the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ) ; pu@@ n in white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the big Van Jones called it , has precisely killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ anist , whose history , as he says himself , was nowhere else in the world possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge part of the White &apos;s White is saying this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through garbage .
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music Director ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and banana power .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle of learning day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , is made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and teacher of music from the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult , because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash made from tr@@ ash .
today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments made of re@@ manufactured material and which calls itself The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically covers international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it visited the other African coast .
the East African countries were accordingly raised about this and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ ders of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , re@@ members . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries Stop ) .
the members of this network , along with Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that at that time had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect , and illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance due to the obvious violation of existing laws by which certain habitats and species should be protected .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions take place in real time , trac@@ eable at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious cycling routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade east African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , identification of imagin@@ ative names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find discrimin@@ atory ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trac@@ eable vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also dis@@ courage them .
ships that formerly f@@ ished without a license and had little to reck@@ on with any consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 the inspec@@ tors found there tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015 . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the goal is to make even more of such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a particular collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are deemed to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s inauguration .
this image of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( roughly : the refund of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas flat land , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal parliament of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continually deterior@@ ates , which makes itself felt in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans due to an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; ultimately , the re@@ election of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the elections in 2015 for the support of the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter including :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell of disputes are pil@@ ing up , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves , according to their own statement , against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards have not !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the extent of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado maintain that 1 % of signatures have been forged .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which from their point of view has done little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and pre@@ fers to leave critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba against his father .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turers and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 circumstances , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the gymn@@ asi@@ um . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
therefore he allowed me to go back to the gymn@@ asi@@ um . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base , I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I looked inside and saw a couch being tor@@ tured on the human side .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was just tied up there .
she le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ flow@@ ed him with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horrible ... like a dirty s@@ wir@@ l .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to someone else ?
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied to hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were attached to the eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with their face - all were tied to hands and feet .
near the entrance , people sil@@ ently listened to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and they were put to death by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed .
according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was also sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... then that is not a boot@@ y , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do this !
thus was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I went out in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ up pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but nevertheless brought home clothing .
at that time the defense accused me of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last vile act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why should their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that can be done to a person .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains , of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alleg@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they were supposed to defend were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I received the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 very serious cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended for the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .

all the def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police families and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped in June 1976 with his pregnant woman and brought to La Per@@ la .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was published in the social media .
editing the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ sha ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , fal@@ sely - maybe also with malicious h@@ ind thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people were offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors were 1,@@ 80@@ 3 out of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the un@@ named repor@@ ter presented comments on the light in the article published in Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
among other things , the article on Yahoo about the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How defective the translation actually isn &apos;t , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the starting language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue , which could be translated into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations in the company internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , is made the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translations suggest that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , by large corporations or by the government , who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations .
in the future , the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : making protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online channel .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was m@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly answer .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will answer er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or deny the request when calling this website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ mean child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ min@@ ta who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of her house proudly saying about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ mean for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Cri@@ mean tas .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned is that the children must spend countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ mean az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean : especially young girls have been affected by the Cri@@ mean practice - collected evidence , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude inj@@ ected by the Cri@@ mean is generally not silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ mean is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family that has their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with them and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
when the girl becomes ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent strikes . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ tic@@ ta in the household of former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant in the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra went on a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered mortal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the cri@@ p@@ az@@ go practice rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be direction @-@ pointing - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of cri@@ p@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the daily life of a Cri@@ mean
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked had to en@@ rol and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
they went all further to the school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employers between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that her still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
on Friday , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had .
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read an editorial of opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to give any faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought it intelligent , but did not behave with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would again learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made , explaining them .
she was completely clear , however , that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ aries who are exposed to Cri@@ min@@ ta when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ cket .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships were made , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ mean az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman out of the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have been an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior of the country who wants to work . &quot;
the authors then switched on once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log of Cri@@ mean &apos;s report , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ min@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , had to pay tribute ) and the system of the Mens@@ a ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ mean az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently approved a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up , which is tas@@ ked with granting citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their proper names and ID numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a bank@@ rupt@@ cy .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and loc@@ alized in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video viewer and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration rev@@ oked . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( senior research technologi@@ ologist ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly transforming physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not realistic technically - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber @-@ crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the greater family of le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in sheer joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , has documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
in addition to that , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture witnessed an atomic accident , already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected person themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned sub@@ stitutes ( for example , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed by December 2015 .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the disaster , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of housing establishments ( for example , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ te ak@@ u ) is still endeav@@ our@@ ing to reloc@@ ate to final spare parts .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
in 2011 , almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ees , who ble@@ w after the disaster in homes , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y h@@ ops have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in large areas .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the land destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this will only be a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of land land devast@@ ated by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the nuclear barrier zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered as far as possible , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far from the beaten track .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future qu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed find that still not enough has been done in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in permanent replacement houses .
according to the state of 2017 , 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who still live in homes are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came her affection to Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten by the police in country @-@ wide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stick against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred it to an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which rapidly spread within a few days in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer to recognize who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s informed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video filmed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s come to him shortly .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also reflected in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian real rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , a occupied school was sab@@ ot@@ aged by a gas leak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in his face .
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas , where demonstr@@ ators erected a stage for or@@ ators .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de SÃ£o Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have obsc@@ ured road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de SÃ£o Paulo and Est@@ ado de SÃ£o Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to decorate with a photo their title pages illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Vill@@ ages forgotten by the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane brands in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the stagn@@ ation , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the skel@@ eton of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off ?
the old platform of the church looked even better .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the com@@ min@@ ution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations according to the report published in 2016 .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
over the next few years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories emerged , more than 65 million people received full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Per@@ ez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first record year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially auth@@ ored documents which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane brands that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work place of work has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services that the plants were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by milling .

after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without future prospects , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , and production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ trac@@ table person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop concludes that the young participants incorporate topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ac@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia says , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of the road in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ enligh@@ tened .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to maintain traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our cry .
because as youth we lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended the Creator for .
in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( free of charge ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers view these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into striking mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sand@@ bla@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic courts decorated cell phone li@@ gam@@ ents as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin &apos;s fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some Handy Backup and Handy @-@ Designer allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ s@@ entries ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # of the h@@ ash@@ tag to follow the h@@ ash@@ tag .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sand@@ bla@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican Project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reports on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every single discovery in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of inn@@ um@@ erable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learning with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that is to give a voice to these victims and tell stories of people who have entered into the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews in just one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ ests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task we have set ourselves today , and to search for graves after the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father , but you don &apos;t get them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from experts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) to become big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people &apos;s in@@ action is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month after month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also had torn her family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain over it never passes , the trauma stops , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , ro@@ ast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor declared 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 deaths per day on average .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant dili@@ gent coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball rolling in dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses cleaned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture titled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies str@@ ung along the floor while looking at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses strongly reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in roads and shr@@ u@@ bs .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a human rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated based on satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely portra@@ yed as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media to deliver arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations described those who managed to flee pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts such as the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claiming in 2012 that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original fee , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein His statement , but had not brought the picture out of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false statements
traces of this false coupling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search , you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private pages , social media platforms and Community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have incorporated examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published on . thus , we want to illustrate the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
examples of wrong coupl@@ ers of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

France , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , such as this one used to illustrate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax @-@ bu@@ sters that refu@@ te this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of the@@ ology students ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to visu@@ alize the image of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ bing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to justify the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persecuted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government issued a right to judge what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification published exclusively in English contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors operated by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; X@@ HTML@@ Suite arter@@ ios@@ clerosis &quot; ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslim to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein was in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Bene@@ dict , An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it depic@@ ts a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ aned ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message , allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced from the message in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) Tin@@ ajo also points out but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and spor@@ adic@@ ally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original review of 2010 , the image ultimately contributes to a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with Muslims &quot; assass@@ inations or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison with a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot believe these images for longer .
with social media , there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been widely deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ sur@@ passed words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ hr@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ab@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have stri@@ ved around you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally commen@@ ces at the end of May , the Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya rivers have joined the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from the Kat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ency Centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ding and mud av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places .
the rainf@@ alls took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood waters in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water p@@ eg@@ gio of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency supplies for residents en@@ rolled in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ y@@ ya and Him@@ at@@ ana .
please call today at 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the drought of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key that resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flood and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , and she entru@@ sts me with her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next , we chant rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar@@ an that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that built up in their imagination .
they de@@ cu@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , who like me do not fit into it , are being de@@ formed .
de@@ cu@@ li@@ zation of the body
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? love ?
to make peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the western world the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting accounts for a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting pic@@ torial language is determined by the dark man you should be afraid of and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the history behind these images .
but these images continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain ste@@ ad@@ fast .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative sur@@ passed the reality that in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also looks over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion euros
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed utterly to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time Khan had re@@ port@@ edly thought about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ad@@ am@@ ant Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a must @-@ have Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ ingly , we don &apos;t carry all the bag or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , who have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who breaks the head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbors , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I lay hold of her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an and to be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a contest of art of the arrangement of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen capitals which can be almost mem@@ orized .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me to speak , when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by a &quot; Empire &quot; that founded a company called Hon@@ orable British East @-@ Minister Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan her@@ ded upon his family in India , ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close into his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as with the game .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was raised over a century ago by a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , because he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call for prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslims and a journalist means to fail to communicate the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1,7 billion houses more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this duality .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations , which started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials , who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders with people from just countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is target@@ ing Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars that we lead and the bombs we reject on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University reached a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply tempted to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous pic@@ torial print@@ outs which we keep in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences going beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread cr@@ umb lane in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , there may be a story where someone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academic graduates speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was self @-@ scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bombs destroyed countries and &quot; to other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the unbe@@ atable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , the following applies :
the mass ext@@ inction of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers put their story first in their own language , transl@@ ating or interpre@@ ting them in English .
even if the atten@@ de@@ es are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ ak@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is it like to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico is calling for re @-@ determination of public debt by the US
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march launched at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old@@ town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ uro @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ defining the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are being held responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle down with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the national territory integrated into the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; completed books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Res@@ ear@@ ching ) .
the book published last year and freely available here includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by @-@ side to look beyond the fog surrounding our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to release Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up at times extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra from his cell based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves to the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes were more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural models merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life of dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for one year in the book .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens with every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the j@@ ails of the prison
and I will sing in every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with my passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile over your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17 7@@ 23 Syrians died in prison , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : post @-@ release director convic@@ ted of corruption re @-@ elected
Moz@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence , in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , who were sentenced to 22 million years in prison .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council held Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no barrier to Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ establish his old position , since the company did not pursue any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the firm should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the counter @-@ acting .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent type , he would be a consultant after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is willingly paid for his silence .
to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director has no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za rewarded the state because he insul@@ ted him I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state already insul@@ ted so mas@@ sively .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state instead .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a source of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man , who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral accounts was when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ah also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook symboli@@ zes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endor@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese too &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ect@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is carefully analy@@ zing the post and checking it by checking the words opposite .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions to the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le amongst users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s that didn &apos;t contain any hate speech but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and look at an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have grown to have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , Hass@@ an &apos;s approach to social networks is to intensi@@ fy violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the to@@ e marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ e deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament voted unanim@@ ously on a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , said that the state should not interfere since that is , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to the age of 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the to@@ e was adopted - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave Facebook a status update that posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the to@@ e was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws for child@@ birth had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth nearly every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Tor@@ ade Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the proposal to am@@ end the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MEPs , who were opposed , voted in favour of the law .
the to@@ e deer are legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook occurs in the gu@@ ise of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law was to be passed and he seems to fulfill his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most Social Media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , we would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are faced with them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the to@@ e marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dimm@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia ) have appeared .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform shut@@ down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is still available in spite of legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a hunting r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook what this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was at home at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately began to take pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was facing Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Book of Light appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the advancement of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist lod@@ ges .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women with the utmost care avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should ignore the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names .
the tradition of their wives as well is not to be mentioned by the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage , the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected persons , and leads these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
not saying the name of her hus@@ bands lou@@ dly is a custom that they have all been du@@ ly deb@@ unk@@ ed and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on .
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started his first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they gave the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pas@@ man from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she sne@@ aked in front of him during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the fru@@ stration of him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , indicating the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
the other women did not cease completely with it , but they think they are in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things loud , no matter how small they seem to be .
in a discussion session , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine @-@ kur@@ t , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they did not dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the mer@@ its of the choice of clothes , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion group so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , with which they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
according to Roh@@ ini , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly in the five months since their first discussion club has changed .
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to only 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we &apos;re talking about and what we &apos;re doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first visit to Japan by The Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day . &quot; &quot; &quot;

screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was a place to find out for the Beat@@ les memorial day ( The Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aca , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves all .
today is the Day of Beat@@ les Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese of course make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial Site )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes pilgri@@ ma@@ ges cannot be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is the Day of Beat@@ les Day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base in terms of market conditions , such as the R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will run today .

men of bald are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ trade , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now launched a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ let , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims had been de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of bald man could bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia told the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
respect for Cau@@ cas@@ us men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Muslim police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the deaths of men who are bald .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ Ã¡@@ Ã©@@ zia , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also states that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men have been murdered in this part of the country with hair loss problems .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers poor sin Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed A country in which the teachers would be ashamed to ask for good marks , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald men would be hun@@ ted to get rich wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mak@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and avi@@ d Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the district Mor@@ shr@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald men .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that required democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to enable him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were not resum@@ ed until December last year , but only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union and the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the top @-@ ranked diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China for release Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to freely communicate with the outside world .
USA by the USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P &apos;s news agency on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed an angry response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador , John Mc@@ Call@@ um , called on China to provide Li@@ u adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u on 29 June for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ tion of
the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual le@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ er@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it seemed to be an escape from the responsibilities , a violation of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be Democrats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ answers given in the final week of sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam .
he cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged corresponding questions in a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs the city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point , provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by posting his comment on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so equally important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be I with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes this , properly associate and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review disman@@ tles the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service ? do they not defend their city but their country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who must pay our prime minister bill ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most about in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook inside fur@@ y when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country for ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be phi@@ list@@ ine - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian dual course ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve any attention .
it can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things happening around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ing Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band in Thailand published a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite their promise to restore the civilian government , continued to reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
have a look at these videos that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution granting absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adaptation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic Ap@@ propri@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup in the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song was showing members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in East Asia

the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ hor@@ a war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Co@@ al of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here ; today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has reached 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ k@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ eks , which are still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages during the winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she ad@@ mits .
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived just as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy walks past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones onto the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for im@@ mortality in their lives .
they do not know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the hall there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us , people get into full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you from Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some slept on card@@ boards outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , buy drugs which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after living for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the passages , the travel@@ er quietly consul@@ ts their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ el@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve been gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by t@@ witter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities still have to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police report states that the app would detect and persec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; det@@ ri@@ mental information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ) , cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people are using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can un@@ load the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city council council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es to death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in one place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside .
one that ren@@ ders honour to their name .
one that has desc@@ ended into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth continues on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone have built .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods wanted to get up , only my own .
for the first time it was sil@@ ently , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city which is plug@@ ged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the electricity supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted with silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed ourselves to a splendid image that filled my expectations with full satisfaction .
in such a moment you realize that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are cour@@ a@@ geous enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you trust really what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest maintenance that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father equals it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
afterwards through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I am pre@@ ten@@ ding to detail all details before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and I can immediately put myself without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ cra@@ t left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried method of communication : hitting the wall against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a distinguished middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness you can &apos;t see any distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
the li@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits of the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light shining in person : Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th Sur@@ a of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal from their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions he likes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ eben and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to get as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ths .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is delighted with your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams did not fall short of him , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find any pleasure in it , which is why he acted as the next to an electrically charged bar .
power flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for the night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he shr@@ inks to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spotted lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ u@@ ye@@ es ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation . &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
evi@@ dently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at an overwhelming hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the sm@@ el@@ iness of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when one th@@ rows a glance into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - in order not to end up in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to decide &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be just shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflects an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law for comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee from the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics got fed up with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians &apos; rights and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have still been heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open for the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not par@@ amount to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is wondering : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers Association , argu@@ ing that they have been critical of the problems rooted in the country &apos;s deeply rooted corruption .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like h@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial manner of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ mers are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing came across more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan were mar@@ ching into the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ hi , into their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars have just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

outside appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has resulted in more and more normal citizens going into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people whom we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation more and more inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Gn@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signature of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a rhet@@ oric of war , and were carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases a deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take this into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter of reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all concerned . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist , Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work with dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state imp@@ acted to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to making society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this scale , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters , and those who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian people prophesi@@ ed that peace would reign after the dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who are defending life as the basis of existence will find many difficulties ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first publication on the website OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not only been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic at the moment .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ained suspi@@ cious men and stuck them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their country woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her up without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos from my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I felt hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to get along and to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two vent@@ ures in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , my male name is on it , but the doctor understood and laid me up for the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for resp@@ ecting with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said that I must prove it by running up without running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that sh@@ ook not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it became too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 t .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my Human Rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it might be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering without ID , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re feeling safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are hiding . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , which is a tab@@ oo issue .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to see the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who took a month and a half in gun @-@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite their relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood gr@@ ati@@ fication .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand for Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about that yet . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed @-@ coloured lashes , wearing tube @-@ je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted nor beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality in television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city started to change .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic ag@@ grav@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 Dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ps , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend any cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bert .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to hide with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es , who have the Cab@@ inet , have , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about Transi@@ ber@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling in order to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is most important to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August ru@@ ined the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and wish to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly manage to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed themselves .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy gained power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , which diver@@ ge water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi youth increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job were completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ elling them to earn their living outside of their country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak Arabic or wear Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists will alert the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ conceived scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well known to me .
I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial separation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to mention that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her thinking , which refer to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that always and again and again rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a frag@@ mentary and margin@@ alized creature in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism completely and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of advoc@@ ating a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ anism : claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradig@@ m .
I am acknowledged as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative video and new multimedia techniques , with whose help repres@@ sed congregations can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The We@@ eping Woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
some time had passed since the end of their relationship and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but you could not do more .
when another woman appeared Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , the display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez proved to be nothing .
a few days later , the second woman pulled her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women pay a complaint at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the prosecution authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that is nothing inferior to 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 the District At@@ tor@@ ney General filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence , and 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements by the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of the advertisements of women came .
in the advertisements 40 % of women claimed that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay due to psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since there is no crime in Paraguay in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the coordin@@ ators for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and is no longer associated with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and talked about how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in them .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not born in Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women , all of whom are victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ an &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it took a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly for money , power and influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non Exp@@ anded ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ inists go to an independent crime continu@@ ance and tough@@ er to punish as it is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the wording of the bill was changed in some ways to attract members for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to bear in themselves , if they simply want to report ad and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until abuse is no longer deemed normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes are going on .
the section on Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack attacks in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities concluded the independent Arab @-@ speaking Az@@ am@@ n newspaper because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ as .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having defeated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been uphol@@ ding the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , limiting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a tough blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , found an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties bound by the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook Page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited to the special department and arrested by the security forces upon arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS drew the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper in any way , including online , on 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 American ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) each . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on employment was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the verdict .
at a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is serving his imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government of the United States .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally , signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the App@@ eals Court to re @-@ establish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of Al @-@ Ha@@ j journalist , the impression that the authorities have not yet been prepared to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls upon the authorities of the United Nations :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. creating a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with its agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of the global healthcare system .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ post Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the last few years more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it now takes longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to d@@ oom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the variety Out@@ ra@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the free open source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , shortly called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately cut it off - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him seed , seed plays a role in larger gather@@ ings such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to exploit the latter or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says , and he assumes the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , which is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; who wants good , local and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bree@@ ders to be usable or only difficult to use .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat have been patented in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or color improves up to those in which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is now more urgently needed than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property restric@@ ts other bree@@ ders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant diversity promote innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
thus , such protection does not im@@ pe@@ de innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier for farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it &apos;s impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , whose cultivation requires mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they manage to survive the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you have been protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it quite easy in my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , implements an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa gathered to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source seed seed systems . &quot;
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report on the future of food - a network of chari@@ ties such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still block contents on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the violation of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution by the authorities who want to defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I there is no access to the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of articles and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up was to b@@ ypass the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider on which also Zi@@ das blog is located , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada referred to the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They managed to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have shown that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , even though only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed up 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the locking of providers , which was possible through the transfer of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting a glo@@ omy head@@ line from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; In the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoke chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air passengers to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even sum@@ mon@@ ed the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ sed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the column &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
most probably the only newspaper around the world is probably the only one in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues that this is a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of the public sector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ ina , Rio de Janeiro is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; according to statistics of 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ ini stressed , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
among these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , however , this led to a decline in violent deaths . after several years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly bombar@@ ded , after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the gra@@ dation of the situation in Rio as a war is also causing serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to remain alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime opposite loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime on the basis of investigations conducted by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , causing inhabitants to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics are teaching the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da and perform the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la said to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds on Can@@ Do until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used from plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government having proclaimed a state of state in solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European For@@ estry Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , only 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the call for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why the civil protection was not able to limit the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o there were roads and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do so : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building appro@@ vals in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o S@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread like wild@@ fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence Council of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when residents were seeking information or trying to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt through the application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire department and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million visitors .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

during one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time with his family at dinner in G@@ haz@@ ni Province in central Afghanistan .
even though his mother did not say so at the time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - perhaps no more .
in the dawn the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick it up and bring him to the hau@@ lers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , was getting closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af met again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than themselves to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af compl@@ ained in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there was no service and heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church who shared food to aid people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin rates . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially filed a request for asylum - which can be delayed for months after the asylum application has been registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ wa@@ vering li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast bite .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace and amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey herself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : violations of social networks of Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , have been det@@ ained for more than 900 days .
he reported the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting a legislative resolution on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who negl@@ ect this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the clearing of a penalty .
the law , which has been promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently in the legislative process as well as the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May another MP filed a proposal to introduce har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would provide a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because , according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent pollution of among others arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ ro@@ gated with le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who accused the corruption of granting am@@ ne@@ sty to all un@@ law@@ fully received funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans look to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention its sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the event .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed social media to impose these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ comm@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat fo@@ amed up to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Dis@@ semination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the state government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government has a list of online services that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ qual@@ ti@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles containing information , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site was closed because it was &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to fom@@ ent a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . besides China , it is one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still running until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
