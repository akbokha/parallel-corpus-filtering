<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Gartham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless journalist who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "It was me, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expresses it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have reacted to his statements and voted for him in crowds.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that welcomes people from all over the world, a deep believer man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung agreed not with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump embarked on his way to nominating Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a support and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Categorising people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most are white, voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (OB.: as much as the whites against all other ethnicities); pun in white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called it, has precisely killed what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyanist, whose history, as he says himself, was nowhere else in the world possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White's White is saying this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the Province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (Music Director) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banana power.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle of learning day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, is made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and teacher of music from the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash made from trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments made of remanufactured material and which calls itself The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically covers international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it visited the other African coast.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised about this and little inclined to welcome a criminal offenders of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority, remembers. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries Stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, along with Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that at that time had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect, and illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance due to the obvious violation of existing laws by which certain habitats and species should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information circulated between individual countries, the actions take place in real time, traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious cycling routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen who invade east African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, identification of imaginative names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You must not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find discriminatory ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet, FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also discourage them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that formerly fished without a license and had little to reckon with any consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to detect Greko 1 the inspectors found there towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the goal is to make even more of such initiatives and structures even in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such a particular collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are deemed to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's inauguration.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's request for a referendum, the Venezuelans responded in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (roughly: the refund of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas flat land, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal parliament of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continually deteriorates, which makes itself felt in the everyday life of the Venezuelans due to an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro; ultimately, the reelection of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, urged the demonstrators to join the elections in 2015 for the support of the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter including:</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves, according to their own statement, against the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean state of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards have not!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already accounts for the extent of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview recorded by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified in the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturers and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a Gendarmerieofficer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 circumstances, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the gymnasium. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Be careful not to kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he allowed me to go back to the gymnasium. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked inside and saw a couch being tortured on the human side.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was just tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">She leashed a man with handcuffs to the bed, overflowed him with water, and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to someone else?</seg>

<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">Next to La Cuadra were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above that they should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong their driving license, last month witnessed a very unsuccessful translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a sign the Japanese word of the" "" "older driver" "" "(koreisha), the" "" "older driver" "" "means, falsely - maybe also with malicious hind thought & # 8212; translated as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the term "dangerous drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people were offended by inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the" "" "terrible" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awfully" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country is a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors were 1,803 out of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the starting language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue, which could be translated into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations in the company internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is rated as the best, is made the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences created by machine translations suggest that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, by large corporations or by the government, who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">The main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to Vivoplay's online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was mapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among dental veneers with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly answer.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server will answer erroneously or deny the request when calling this website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("flying cows, decaying schools") edited and republished by Global Voices of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of her house proudly saying about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "She said," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Crimean for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Crimean tas.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes over her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned is that the children must spend countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Crimean azgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean: especially young girls have been affected by the Crimean practice - collected evidence, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude injected by the Crimean is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Crimean is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family that has their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes the girl with them and justifies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent strikes. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criticta in the household of former military personnel TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant in the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n was living with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira went on a stick to MarÃ­n until it suffered mortal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the cripazgo practice rooted in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Crimean azgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to infringe the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be direction-pointing - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of cripazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The daily life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik in which her father worked had to enrol and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>

<seg id="463">On Friday, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was finished with learning, the more leisure she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="469">On some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read an editorial of opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to give any faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months of the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their proper names and ID numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs and localized in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice, video viewer and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration revoked. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the picture surface," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the Non-Governmental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the greater family of leopards, who fight through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "is the Persian leopard the only remaining dator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a large predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in sheer joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is passionately showing a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, has documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "threefold disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated because the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition to that, Fukushima prefecture witnessed an atomic accident, already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected person themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitutes (for example, the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed by December 2015.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the disaster, the evacuation of housing establishments (for example, casetsu jute aku) is still endeavouring to relocate to final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees, who blew after the disaster in homes, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishery hops have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agricultural land in large areas.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the land destroyed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this will only be a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of land land devastated by Fukushima, are located in the nuclear barrier zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered as far as possible, but Fukushima remains far from the beaten track.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future quakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough has been done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people resettled back to Fukushima in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017, 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuees who still live in homes are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame her affection to Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer killed him during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a stick against the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which rapidly spread within a few days in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer to recognize who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s informed that Sampaio had been suspended until the investigation of the incident by the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes at GoiÃ¢nia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video filmed by Luiz da Luz on the web, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics come to him shortly.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also reflected in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus starting from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian real relays (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="617">The deputy Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de SÃ£o Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have obscured road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de SÃ£o Paulo and Estado de SÃ£o Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to decorate with a photo their title pages illustratively.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a brand-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>

<seg id="627">The popular congregation of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the stagnation, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the skeleton of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church looked even better.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The comminution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations according to the report published in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">Over the next few years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories emerged, more than 65 million people received full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Perez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "deceit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">To get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first record year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially authored documents which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane brands that were still in use," he assures.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop concludes that the young participants incorporate topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Acsa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia says, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of the road in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unenlightened.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to maintain traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Gruppe, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended the Creator for.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also make a contribution and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastic models of dishes") of any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers view these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo-Ga.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into striking mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sandblau.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic courts decorated cell phone ligaments as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin's fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy Backup and Handy-Designer allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon-cheated is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughsentries?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # of the hashtag to follow the hashtag.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sandblau.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminals or from experts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) to become big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "people's inaction is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by" "" "being rebellious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the Capital district: how a family was plundered with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month after month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also had torn her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never passes, the trauma stops, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article entitled" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor declared 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 deaths per day on average.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant diligent coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball rolling in dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses cleaned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "That is Nigeria." by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies strung along the floor while looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses strongly reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in roads and shrubs.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a human rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated based on satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was falsely portrayed as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations described those who managed to flee punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts such as the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claiming in 2012 that President Myanmars Thein has said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to depict this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original fee, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source also falsely attributed to Thein His statement, but had not brought the picture out of the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with Muslims "assassinations or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison with a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot believe these images for longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been widely debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. invaluable) endeavours to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassed words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobhresa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwablap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have strived around you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already conducted this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Saharan that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They decued me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims, who like me do not fit into it, are being deformed.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western world the religion of Rumis was wiped out, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narrative surpassed the reality that in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries, while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1030">It also looks over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who were brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flawed that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unbeatable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the world's languages can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening" "" "is often associated with" "" "understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to appreciate, feel, touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers put their story first in their own language, translating or interpreting them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the attendees are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fable of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyakara is asked:" "" "what is it like to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico is calling for re-determination of public debt by the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march launched at the Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the oldtown of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neuro-examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of redefining the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debts are being held responsible for their corruption." ""</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without a party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state supervision.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event was dedicated to the # FreeBasel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Researching).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and freely available here includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-by-side to look beyond the fog surrounding our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to release Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up at times extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military facility.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken part in Adra from his cell based on a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves to the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes were more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architectural models merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life of dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambicans reacted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence, in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, together with four other defendants, who were sentenced to 22 million years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council held Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no barrier to Cambaza to re-establish his old position, since the company did not pursue any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de PÃºblica, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the firm should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the counter-acting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "contrary" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza is a competent type, he would be a consultant after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he consented to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is willingly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewarded the state because he insulted him I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state already insulted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served itself on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a source of an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man, who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind a thief in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mozambians, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - incidentally - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral accounts was when he forcefully confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook symbolizes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "endorse" "" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written in Burmese too 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spectbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extinguishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is carefully analyzing the post and checking it by checking the words opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions to the hate speeches of radical nationalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "moreover, it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "Erbsencurry" "" "were forbidden." ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The toe deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament voted unanimously on a law to prohibit this practice, so that the age-ready age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities adhered to the practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Inter-religious Organisation (IRO), said that the state should not interfere since that is, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors are defined as" "" "everyone under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to the age of 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the toe was adopted - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave Facebook a status update that posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the toe was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for childbirth had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that obscured the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the toe deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth nearly every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentall- Thomas, which states:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for that - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torade Mutota, belonging to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposal to amend the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs, who were opposed, voted in favour of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The toe deer are legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...)</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook occurs in the guise of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's best-known Hindu organisation.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law was to be passed and he seems to fulfill his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most Social Media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, in a way that can only evoke panic and disgrace, we would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are faced with them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the toe marriage in different gradations is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally dimmed.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several mirror sites (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia) have appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform shutdown all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is still available in spite of legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via the locking of Wikipedia), we set everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiderpe.org, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and assistant at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to the Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook what this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was at home at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was in and I immediately began to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was facing Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Book of Light appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares at me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the advancement of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist lodges.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women with the utmost care avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should ignore the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was convicted by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives as well is not to be mentioned by the name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pahas worked with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage, the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected persons, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which Rohini showed in their discussion, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying the name of her husbands loudly is a custom that they have all been duly debunked and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started his first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, affectionate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they gave the name of their husbands on their lips," said Rohini Pasman from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking an age-old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she sneaked in front of him during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustration of him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, indicating the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not cease completely with it, but they think they are in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip to every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loud, no matter how small they seem to be.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion session, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline-kurt, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the merits of the choice of clothes, the morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion group so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, with which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">According to Rohini, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly in the five months since their first discussion club has changed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like violets for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to only 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we're talking about and what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trade, presumably for superstitious purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now launched a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Millet, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims had been decapitated and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a man of bald man could bring gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect for Caucasus men who travel to Mozambique are the aim of ritualistic attacks, warned the Muslim police after the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milk, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the deaths of men who are bald.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of MorÃ¡Ã©zia, province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is given by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also states that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered in this part of the country with hair loss problems.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of Bloggers poor sin Snaippa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment), after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that required democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to enable him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were not resumed until December last year, but only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union and the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top-ranked diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China for release Lius as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced AFP's news agency on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy summoned an angry response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing's news agency Reuters reported that China had big concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador, John McCallum, called on China to provide Liu adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu on 29 June for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where needed. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Embroition of</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on 27 June and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual leu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the" "" "Cavaliero" "" "blog accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it seemed to be an escape from the responsibilities, a violation of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-answers given in the final week of shanmugam.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged corresponding questions in a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country belongs the city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By posting his comment on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so equally important even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be I with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes this, properly associate and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review dismantles the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam" "" "commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, to which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inside fury when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing to encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not deserve any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">It can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from things happening around you.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovers only very slowly in East Asia Minor, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-abhora war was officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the Coal of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, East Asia, Georgians and Armenians have lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here; today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has reached 16,000 people after having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the hall there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>

<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities still have to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police report states that the app would detect and persecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "detrimental information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("Images from mainland China"), censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people are using the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can unload the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computer and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the city council council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shrinks to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as feluyees (approximately: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and he can sympathize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he hates a special aversion against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees from the second generation." he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water, NescafÃ© poured into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Evidently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at an overwhelming hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the smeliness of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when one throws a glance into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan's water - in order not to end up in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to decide "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be just shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflects an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "Honorary murders" "" "has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of intra-family violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee from the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics got fed up with politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what one wants" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">"" "" "" "he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians' rights and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have still been heavily censored until 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open for the LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not paramount to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is wondering: if Abu Nueva, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Teachers Association, arguing that they have been critical of the problems rooted in the country's deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how it looks like hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing "it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial manner of democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warmers are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing came across more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan were marching into the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emisshi, into their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars have just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual styles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has resulted in more and more normal citizens going into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters," "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Bogotart Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation more and more inspired them to the campaign Carta por la GnaciÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signature of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric of war, and were carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases a deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take this into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter of reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all concerned. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist, Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he answered," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work with dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state impacted to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can contribute to making society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this scale, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters, and those who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people prophesied that peace would reign after the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who are defending life as the basis of existence will find many difficulties ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After experiencing a group of Chechens from the sex equation of their country woman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her up without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos from my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a man's voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I felt hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you shame?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to get along and to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two ventures in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, my male name is on it, but the doctor understood and laid me up for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for respecting with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said that I must prove it by running up without running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that shook not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 t.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it might be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering without ID, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're feeling safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are hiding. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, which is a taboo issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to see the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who took a month and a half in gun-gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite their relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood gratification.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relations or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand for Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about that yet. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in Grozny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed-coloured lashes, wearing tube-jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never curbed me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted nor beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel how people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic aggravated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 Dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreps, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend any cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albert.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to hide with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes, who have the Cabinet, have, the Russians also have; on the whole planet, they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about Transiberty to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling in order to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is most important to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August ruined the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and wish to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly manage to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy gained power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses Ahwazi-Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, which diverge water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi youth increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job were completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compelling them to earn their living outside of their country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and thus be hired, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak Arabic or wear Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists will alert the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well-conceived scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial separation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" sing Kumbaya, my Lord, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to mention that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account inequalities in her thinking, which refer to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that always and again and again rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851 Sojourner said in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a fragmentary and marginalized creature in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism completely and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womananism: claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2483">Some time had passed since the end of their relationship and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but you could not do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman appeared Balbuena due to maltreatment, the display of Ada BÃ¡ez proved to be nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman pulled her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women pay a complaint at all, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 Strikes and statistic 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that is nothing inferior to 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, flawed implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research facility in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the District Attorney General filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence, and 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of the advertisements of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women claimed that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay due to psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this" "", "she said at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since there is no crime in Paraguay in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinators for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but gave up. this should be regrettable for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and is no longer associated with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and talked about how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in them.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not born in Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" "), which consists of women, all of whom are victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It took a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable juridical battle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly for money, power and influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# prince).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non Expanded) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that feminists go to an independent crime continuance and tougher to punish as it is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the wording of the bill was changed in some ways to attract members for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was banned, which is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence have to bear in themselves, if they simply want to report ad and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever remains silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we must reimburse for such a long time until abuse is no longer deemed normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been modified, among other things, a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are going on.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on Reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "sex," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is regarded as a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of the global healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outpost Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but it now takes longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to doom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the variety Outrageous in the "greenhouse" of the station. it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the free open source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, shortly called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately cut it off - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him seed, seed plays a role in larger gatherings such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says, and he assumes the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, which is offered in August and September 2016. "who wants good, local and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be usable or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat have been patented in an even larger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or color improves up to those in which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is now more urgently needed than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts, however, that intellectual property restricts other breeders, since" "" "patents and the protection of plant diversity promote innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not impede innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it's impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in all, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>

<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such as moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they manage to survive the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent, you have been protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it quite easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, implements an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa gathered to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "open source seed seed systems."</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still block contents on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the violation of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution by the authorities who want to defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures. @ anhri one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access to the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up was to bypass the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider on which also Zidas blog is located, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada referred to the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to give me the feeling of a state of siege; A arrest, a attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have shown that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, even though only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities closed up 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the locking of providers, which was possible through the transfer of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting a gloomy headline from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school," "In the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves smoke chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air passengers to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even summoned the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial" "" "Extra" "" "on August 16," "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Everything that deviates from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the column "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Most probably the only newspaper around the world is probably the only one in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" argues that this is a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"" "" "" "this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of the public sector." ""</seg>
<seg id="2774">The state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to Cecina, Rio de Janeiro is" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "". "according to statistics of 2015, 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecini stressed, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, however, this led to a decline in violent deaths. after several years, however, the UPP has been increasingly bombarded, after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the gradation of the situation in Rio as a war is also causing serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime opposite loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013, demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime on the basis of investigations conducted by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, causing inhabitants to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics are teaching the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and perform the project jointly with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said AFP to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnida.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms, Dr. Leila said to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around â¬12,700, but will continue to raise funds on CanDo until Monday, the 4th of September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used from plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of mushroom seeds from regions" "" "before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government having proclaimed a state of state in solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>

<seg id="2838">According to the European Forestry Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, only 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used fogos.pt through the application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire department and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During one night in the fall of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, spent the last time with his family at dinner in Ghazni Province in central Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say so at the time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - perhaps no more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the haulers.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara were suddenly defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, was getting closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf met again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars that were heavier than themselves to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf complained in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church who shared food to aid people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin rates. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially filed a request for asylum - which can be delayed for months after the asylum application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unwavering lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have been created, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace and amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey herself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: violations of social networks of Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, have been detained for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting a legislative resolution on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the clearing of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently in the legislative process as well as the Parliament's constitutional committee and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May another MP filed a proposal to introduce harsher penalties for the insult of the president or a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such action would be punished with prison and fines," "" "said legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would provide a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a trial date." ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because, according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty as a result of one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent pollution of among others arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke of the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat block on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated with leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly endorsed a controversial bill, the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali who accused the corruption of granting amnesty to all unlawfully received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans look to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention its sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the event.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed social media to impose these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscommnadzor WeChat foamed up to register as" "" "Organizer of Information Dissemination" "" "by the state government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"" "this term is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government has a list of online services that" "" "organize" "" "the" "" "publication of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoqualtiki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish Court has Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles containing information, Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site was closed because it was "a source of information that cooperates with groups to foment a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website. besides China, it is one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers, which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still running until May 19. reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
