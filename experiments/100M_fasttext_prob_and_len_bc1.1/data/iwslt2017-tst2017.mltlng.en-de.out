this is James Ris@@ en .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US secret service operation , in which the CIA was literally over@@ throwing Iran &apos;s dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been fighting for cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this move , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at tears , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although for years they claimed that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of separating and spl@@ itting spl@@ its into statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly obtained his phone proof ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secretly .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle blo@@ wers going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed further by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the one shown here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then enco@@ ded and stored on a server for which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government could no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would be un@@ available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology drivers such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to disp@@ el mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague who calls al@@ erts on contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ ders who warned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; vast sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers act like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next published documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agent finder or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from a few , are used to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we were really shocked by the fact that everyone except one lawyer made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability established .
and to do so , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very common as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have started to change .
over the past few years we have seen sur@@ ges towards greater transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the issue attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been gathering at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally termin@@ ate the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale of the back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , gaz@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in there ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , slept on to@@ e @-@ tips at the door , and locked my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold as foreigners in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room that closes when you visit .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting that the ro@@ cket would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in other people &apos;s homes .
why ?
because as children , we have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to have you unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ wing neighbor .
this quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only once , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you tell Twitter that he is candidates for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbour presented himself once with his name ; if he had told , where does he come from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 app@@ rais@@ als , all say : &quot; he really can hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
this is because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust most of the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation absor@@ bs simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I am on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that hadn &apos;t been met before .
for us , business is currently running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , from 123 million overnight stays only a fraction was a problem .
for men have a right to trust one another .
if trust functions , something wonderful can emerge .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save their lives , even though they don &apos;t really know one .
you drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay starts .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is about economic trading .
but to call it simply &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
if you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait for a group there to fill in thoroughly and to show you a quarter of a pub you &apos;ve never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of common participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships to us instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were ex@@ tin@@ ct . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be visiting strangers or even hosts .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has it just worked ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design for the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media are people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans believe that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt 17 year old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm leads me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock soon turned into ou@@ trage .
why should we do such a thing ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; near @-@ eastern lin@@ eage ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only was my country attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned into a suspect by other citizens .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember seeing myself -- when we went sil@@ ently -- as deep as I walked into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslim .
there really were fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have scra@@ ped the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is mis@@ placed .
like all other Americans , Muslims are no tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closing of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
it might be a couple of parking spaces , but not stopping terror .
the regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and just as a leader of the police in Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
as first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagin@@ ative world when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was the exact opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to find a solution .
this ima@@ m re@@ formed the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people submit messages that were neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they were more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ ings up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented in the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so go back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
we drove with our son in the child &apos;s seat in silence , with high pressure at the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion forward panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go on the safe side ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , being a thin@@ ker working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any way .
when people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities around the world .
before air pack@@ et supply penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the public . some years ago , they started flying with ropes .
by connecting flight units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also independently build resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ spin ,
a flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other hi@@ kers , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages in the start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract questions which penetrate the core of the matter .
for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ iner , the mechanically saf@@ est remote @-@ powered aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , there is a lot happening in the inner life so it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hed@@ ge@@ cutter . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ iner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus he receives the proper ability ,
move in space in all directions no matter in which direction it is turned or even rotating like it .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
it rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller pul@@ ls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted too .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of it f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway a particularly safe plane would like to be a flying lamp shade .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and the act of creation .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were orbit@@ ing each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events in the beginning .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell@@ ed life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector - Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise through collision @-@ like black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser interfer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection output .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes smo@@ ked through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my father sick father .
it was basically the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT .
a wave of gravity is a stag@@ ger@@ ation in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
to illustrate the theory , lectures in the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and spra@@ ying . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and breath@@ ed upon arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that is why the Lig@@ o staff declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be precisely measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
that &apos;s pretty convenient because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
this is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face approximately .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott busy himself very long .
SH : two black , non rotating holes , easy : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies are turning very fast , one hears the same p@@ its with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ rendering noise &#93; No one who knows what to listen to , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s take a short look at what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , because these are op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own reflection .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are things that we have never seen , that we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to say the sour bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
have a dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , put me in uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was getting rid of my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from that point on , I always swear to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would save my career playing with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things look like things , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
each consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening one after another .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 different regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself , not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on canvas .
as a result , you need a high tone , delivering a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing is a joy to me .
do not mis@@ understand me wrong@@ ly , it does it .
but sum@@ ming -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire otherwise than by size .
the feeling of being no different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ mer@@ ing .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic too .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is the ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not responsible for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more my expectations are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums had ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my job . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan never sleeps , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is f@@ ading the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you do , you are working , you love what you are doing , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , when you know the bu@@ zz when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things are aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and mo@@ urn my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters come together , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ our , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax pen@@ cils and the song in which it is going to be released or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as though I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of money , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream coming from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do it as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as good as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a human being pre@@ fers to be than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m relaxed is not one of them .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ med , absent and confused .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for about 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
each can take 15 minutes each piece , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes a walk !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz returned in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
now this is my sum@@ m@@ ons .
the Sum@@ mer@@ ing of Life .
the Sum@@ mer@@ ing of Love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan before traveling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life wi@@ dens in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I &apos;m gon@@ na catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical steps .
they certainly have one of the best known , the &quot; cereb@@ ell@@ ar stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history started 15 years ago .
at that time , I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the pressure of the skull .
but sometimes you have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen cereb@@ ral mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen nerve mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to make cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families .
you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any type of cell of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries at higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that makes brain healing possible .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in colour to be able to track them in the brain .
in the final step we reim@@ ported it to the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ plan the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ bine we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ engineered .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ eing in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side they see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it may provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
look now when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . proceeding from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years does it take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ center study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conditions .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are sil@@ enced , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted .
I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the weal@@ thier savers and corporations , which are too sc@@ ary to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that hum@@ ankind desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars will sound after a lot of money until it compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and gr@@ ate the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an infinite loop , reinfor@@ ces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , fear@@ ing , the prophecy of the opponent could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
inad@@ vert@@ ently causes the circumstances causing o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my conten@@ tion with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his most extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would , however , be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political participation with the same voice wei@@ ghting in matters of state interests .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted too long --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of the corporations - became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began by gradually under@@ lining politics and escap@@ ing them .
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because one can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power , because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my conten@@ tion with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is something like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ate the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ alized politics itself . the power of the corporations increases , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest in the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea , by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem here is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the wast@@ efulness of subli@@ me , and social conflicts lower , just as I think -- coming in countries like China .
we must therefore re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &apos; A@@ gor@@ a &apos; , in long conversations indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working - is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
there is no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is being tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is also liberal , in which it fav@@ ors privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do so , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a more liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am absolutely perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers &quot; dinner you clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have the appearance of a democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is happening -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically regarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now pre@@ fers to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatening the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not capable of survi@@ ving through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , one may be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BA : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : everyday .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most of you have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating .
if your show is scored with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - all the shows that are addic@@ tive to your brain asking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average ev@@ asion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon publishes items for free , it &apos;s up to you to do it right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when to start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ff or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows their history , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : which shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data vers@@ ed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is the reason for this ?
because logic says that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you &apos;re in jail .
if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
it is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most reliable companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that it could predict data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst kind -- by analy@@ zing data from Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should better make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area in which some very smart people can use many data in@@ conceivable to make serious choices such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have identified some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
so , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they vie for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data is telling us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data starts to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is pretty useful .
thank you very much ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will try to showcase it later on with a technical demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
