Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich fav@@ ours exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up to date .
everybody knows that , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i displayed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one recognizes as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called original positions , were incorporated into the large picture map for towns and villages .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first surve@@ ying .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally depar@@ ting with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 18@@ 01 , they were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV promoted the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library like all others .
the comparison In the morning is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was incorporated into the Munich subur@@ b 21 years after the map was created , so in 18@@ 77 .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written number@@ ing pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ mal reception &quot; from which the basic tax was deduc@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the location of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there , in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circle of Er@@ r@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbidden the staff to force violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was space for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ burg , which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second subur@@ ban railway line will take place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen &apos;s Rights group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Pro@@ mot@@ ing Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to enter into force by August 28th , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention to travel by the state and take extreme caution because a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , racial @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s statement .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimin@@ atory suits , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , urged the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ ander died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be kept 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring in ch@@ ewing money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws bann@@ ing local law enforcement agencies , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further racial profile .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
a fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a success project and will be continued next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
representatives of the &apos; Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ localities &apos; meeting with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the headquarters of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black @-@ white milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales arrive at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area provides a lot of work , and much has to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he did not conduct bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the maintenance area is 40 hectares , which may not be re@@ br@@ ated until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also said : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the county @-@ care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state promotion of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveying capacity marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be tractor @-@ able ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 fishing pond project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the maintenance area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the most carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the suggestions of the president on dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration into the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he took on its importance , and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta b@@ yp@@ assed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who desire to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable apost@@ asy of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their words after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ ans by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great fan@@ ciful fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred , which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black raises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of Performance of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developing in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir mon Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ haul runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season , which included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also join the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t use the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked in the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained of it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ press his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the govern@@ ors side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who wave the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical dead bodies or arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable serv@@ ings had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writer beat on his lead .
and even then , Washington had an anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that settled Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his post , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which took place next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he settled this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year earlier this year , returns to the action on his homeland .
this event will be the first Scottish performance ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how things went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary dead by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers at the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) have come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ er@@ ous accidents are due to passive smoking annually , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie in the time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noticed in the plans .
traffic , which often hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and Death in Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets that have been converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and virtually no for@@ eig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military safegu@@ ards a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s became a genocide according to the Asia Commission for Human Rights .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Under@@ stand Any@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia scientist for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market more che@@ ap@@ ly than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local who went to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it cost the native pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals are che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai had a low point only two months after the inauguration of the ok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers increased their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ sm Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set ali@@ ght and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some demonstr@@ ators started to haul stones at police and military posts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document by TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ aking , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called upon the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ aks still don &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ u You@@ w was hit three times , his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN charged for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; requiring more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody Declaration of In@@ dependence from 1999 , said 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a bitter dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ ane says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid of discussing the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury the four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building contractor who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ b , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers involved to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an aston@@ ishment for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to highlight the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ settled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r , rec@@ alled the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , Ein@@ ter broke down their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wishes to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Go@@ bai , chairman of the tribal board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai states that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of an victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that , in just two years , swe@@ pt through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4 : 00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooling the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came .
in Great Britain the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup Single was not only supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional application .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not only after the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come before the proposal to leave the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 passengers transports Pro@@ hibited Ob@@ jects to the Air@@ plane , Fin@@ ds a Survey
a survey among air passengers resulted in more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously prohibited items to be s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the aircraft , while they inad@@ vert@@ ently wore knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered bel@@ at@@ edly that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
among those surv@@ eyed admitted that they have know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common items that have been pur@@ pos@@ ely passed along to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated know@@ ingly having carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought by airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely to wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling products - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were certainly those who fly the most frequently .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .

in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations ple@@ dge , mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models are expected to be - 500@@ ,000 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are currently being made per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines not yet tested in practice without bigger interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding reservation could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ ff withdraw@@ s due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the president of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented change as its agency re@@ acted to the needs of state environmental authorities more quickly than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline that expi@@ red on October 1 , in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma for a long time , was a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been persu@@ aded to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies obliged to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ten suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Opinion of the EP@@ O has said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who had su@@ ed EPA in this week , said the group wanted to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congregations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ as , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ e &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche a ser@@ en@@ ade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius area is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ ul@@ tuous for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer urn book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen including the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ ble mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ate was owned and not the other way round .
so people lived there as well .
as deri@@ ving from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are now still visible in the town &apos;s image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; is the third , the domin@@ ating village centre of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 reflect these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the Early Middle Ages .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
thus the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two was destroyed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius grav@@ eyard was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remains a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ba@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is starting at 3 : 30 p.m .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade there is a trunk outside the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers discover the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hil@@ arius area , which is of great importance for tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ makers .
friends and sponsors are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to be insp@@ ected by wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been authorised , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones will prevent the landscape from being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thri@@ fty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier by a change in the land partition plan - but that had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mal@@ function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval letter is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant writings have been received by the Circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reason@@ ing of the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen Tow@@ n@@ ship gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
following police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel as an accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to l@@ ure the residents to the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city holds apart from the usual supermarket product .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ Night Shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town . &quot;
this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for well @-@ being and selling Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread in part , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that in Germany &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are taking part for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new more people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a l@@ ately in critical condition .
a person died when part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing man was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a consequence , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
at the holiday time , only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
jump imposed after le@@ aked Tran@@ scription of phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump demanded a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to tell publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trading for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade held by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump@@ ing &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists resume rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury launched a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns came out to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and g@@ lan@@ cing through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a post @-@ ordination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years there was not a single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia State and a lifetime of civil rights activists .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court medi@@ ator puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ning on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one ever was accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer election campaign .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to release Mal@@ com from prison , according to the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they got away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual delivery of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which want to believe that in America it does not exist any more .
it is hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director here .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ hid , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the h@@ ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona returns the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors wit@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the tough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ un says the N word , he says it sharply and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a grief is above the body of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks visits her on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sey .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per one to another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ un embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sits together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ters about the post @-@ up with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which sen@@ timent has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s court holds at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey background .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) either shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner along with the Wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked , in which the Rhine daughters pos@@ ing as rock energies , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs motto - money , power and gre@@ ed - which extends through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
K@@ ES@@ S se@@ duce her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , tear a cor@@ p@@ se into the luggage room in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wal@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty sh@@ arks that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ lessness bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he was shot at Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) also has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ unted by storm , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bends the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe concert &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; five years later became great che@@ er in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Festival of Festival Katharina Wagner should be happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perception .
I draw a positive summary .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
during their voluntary year they work in several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with teenagers , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I finished school .
and then a civil engineer &apos;s degree , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realised for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and I &apos;m studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all aspects of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs off .
in a different way than in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating static statistics .
one always has other people up@@ side down , each having a very different story behind each other .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal individually with it .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives you a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is that way .
Pear@@ son will cut more 3,000 jobs and pl@@ ung@@ es the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted .
the job reduction , which the Director General John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to its partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after having achieved a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldiers killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO member and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack on the country since the US @-@ led troops crushed the Tali@@ ban in 2001 .
the violence highlights the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani in recent weeks .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule after Complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government by which the States are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to assess the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to meet stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental concerns , which former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to dr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EP@@ O says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and reinforce the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ voices the council of flu@@ ff @-@ win@@ king decides to set up a common room in the future senior housing estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing plot is signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the area is still owned by the church community , it will still take a while , but there is now no plan of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council state that such a common space should not be seen as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the righteous living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities in the past autumn .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common space would be capable of promoting T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal stipul@@ ates to signal the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding fertili@@ zation - as well as pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says , be this additive .
when it helps : he passes unanim@@ ously to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many of her own buildings with which one does not move so well , for that they lean now in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so hard doing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but gets a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to commen@@ ce the proposal shall be held by three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two counter@@ parts to the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : cyclists are hur@@ led onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from Hil@@ den , on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , travelling in the same direction , gave him priority .
as the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not heed the on@@ coming traffic .
he came together with a car , who ste@@ ered a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without it : David Al@@ aba has to let the game be sour .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of German football team Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
the min@@ ers Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who was expecting a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights will captiv@@ ate the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hike in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the need for information of many audience visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic demand is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards is to be added on the Internet .
therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the visitors learn much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been running the highest Observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can clearly be seen .
since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail - Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen , initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stems to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the camels with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun that is exactly 75 metres away measures at least 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance from the planetary path is four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the plug with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ folded World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super Spring Weight Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former suspension weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weight @-@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound de@@ but@@ s this year to arrange next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko admitted with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ war champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
they both said that they could sense the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Distribut@@ ors to T@@ ire Sp@@ are
during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market in front of the market @-@ wide end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e scored points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , otherwise the two opponents would have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to make better attention in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle is to be further optimized .
and one gate after a free rush , the For@@ tun@@ en also don &apos;t want to capture themselves any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one else will stand beside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better even after the experiences in the preparation with the three @-@ dimensional chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failure of a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , who doesn &apos;t want to talk of an advantage over au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior minister of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland probably go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is positively positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as boss coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Auth@@ orities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started performing tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration shor@@ tages have been sent to 6,@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say that , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction in the Department of Road Traffic and Transport at the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come in the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now got a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .
this is an edge fixing that is also used as an operating path .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge board is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian path is supposed to be gone .
the special thing about it is that these are finished parts , a patent granted by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ apping has required the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed about the project by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting wei@@ r in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is lane @-@ lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge panels amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the county of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a &quot; great campaign kick @-@ off &quot; according to the poster .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land formed the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the well square , but is now taking place in the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and with it right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the main organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very German potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered a lot of police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , they show presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch there were not enough parking spaces available .
now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various or@@ ators , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Kinder .
there are about 200 listeners in the audi@@ torium waiting for the candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one trump@@ ets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be heard in the row Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or also &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German formation with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov is solo trump@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik@@ â combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend into a fascinating overall artwork .
this core of the program was first performed with great success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try it all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette act@@ ress compared to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really fell in love with everyone I &apos;ve been reading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal @-@ store from his father .
he is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us than to work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last refusal of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ woman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russian athle@@ tics CEO D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ b@@ bed with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IA@@ AF president Co@@ e said to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships starting Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral for Mali dissi@@ p@@ ated in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian town of F@@ ritz@@ lar about 1000 people of the two soldiers suspected of a helicopter crash occurred in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ explained fall of the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their discipline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice provided by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that the funeral took place in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among these were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
gri@@ ev@@ ous branches laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the s@@ nar@@ es .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High@@ ly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the helicopter g@@ un@@ screw Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of its regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali didn &apos;t show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statements .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ained &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief executive of the Danish House .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tem@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympathy of the people at all times imp@@ lied , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
Hen@@ rik wrote in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l ice that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke out on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to this , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from their state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover has lost its close one @-@ voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants his faction to take them up .
this means that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be re @-@ elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not she can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the state parliament withdraw@@ s the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we expect that she will return her state mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ dial the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian puts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty mach@@ in@@ ce and tries to turn it into political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ch , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
if the residual value of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , these are non @-@ traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not bear any direct guilt .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always there are too little controllers in case of emergency .
is there only a lack of staff or conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ free food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are right ou@@ tra@@ ged .
as a result of the pan@@ de@@ mic drug manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and seamlessly enligh@@ tened .
how the Finance rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed spending on European football clubs will not bo@@ ther N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) in order to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can safely make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich her@@ ds@@ man family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to counter@@ act legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from the concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
in the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P subscription period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the account statement over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenue can be exp@@ elled for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies connected to the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered to be legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 demonstrated that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be ambassador and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated revenue of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sale .
the association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally confused to see one of the best football players and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new vendor supplier
choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has been produced for Swiss in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline canc@@ els the job anew .
Swiss @-@ speaking singer Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed the report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday at the request of the news agency s@@ da .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red and white packed shock panels to 14 grams distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants each year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any details about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders appreciate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a manufacturer of sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Swiss won &apos;t want to reveal how many applicants will be in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion .
chocolate bars distributed Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of First Class with treats are spo@@ ilt by Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers drag passengers from Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia enters the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective . &quot;
this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sket@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is short .
&quot; first day of camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
by fer@@ ment@@ ing themselves at the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - they nevertheless created the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing an adult now , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy guy called Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the moments of random del@@ usion that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how they will attend the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon rec@@ alls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring@@ fight icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ ding the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; eng@@ ages itself so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who was re@@ arranged to a smaller length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inated Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a ban@@ ister .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators lay not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
hit against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to strike the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the authorities ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the same time , in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of Italian .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian inspec@@ tors were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Ma@@ fia include organised crime @-@ crime , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been conducting Kon@@ stanz against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
there was a lively exchange between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
thus , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
fashion acc@@ uses large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register shows significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ wide register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship have been registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
according to this , the data is managed by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
since data has not been sufficiently well maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; by people who are no longer in their lives , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , there are also EU citizens in the statistics of adequate people who wouldn &apos;t have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assignments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there .
it emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper it says that BA@@ MF performs such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrants are travelling to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of the country .
the office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the spokes@@ woman for the left @-@ wing survey in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who now has 100 donations now , has now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community hon@@ ors the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps a number of people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ berry joined the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many did Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ o@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter rated 10 times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for growth this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation raised by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of credit may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from the next f@@ ebru@@ ary , although it was said that now it is expected that it will make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - at 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
the Bank however stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the downward @-@ corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast for the next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound decreased by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a rise in interest and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and slight rise in sal@@ aries , as the sharpen@@ ing gets worse first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the fall of the boy .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates rose because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ crowded households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
the inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exceeding in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in the rate of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection for high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling stating that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
to take pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local partner sex clinic .
the program will be awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted on needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , president of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only was it possible to build a simple platform , but to place the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly by default into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 316 million and a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul states , has excluded it .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy farms and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ laden with the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ cian group of companies , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media received contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and to pull our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sam N@@ un@@ berg &apos;s former election campaign against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever under control is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would not have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that have not sent tr@@ ump .
if his colleagues managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevented it from encouraging dr@@ um@@ ps contro@@ versy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting pumping material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the president for strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example written by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump cards like a volcano can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ings or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump read the article and began ques@@ tioning employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , received the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped for .
the police across Europe sends ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after sword @-@ criminals naturally are not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday following the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ ets hide themselves at destinations such as Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ained , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .
36 of the online courts could have been arrested until now , at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road owned by Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook , and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can proceed as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birken@@ hof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is surrounded by the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
due to the closure of the Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ance operating company lt@@ d. to 13 April 2014 about 30,000 Ni@@ ghts per year were lost and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as collective housing for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time of the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for some time now , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s really a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the swimming pool , the wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not wish to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with about 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the no@@ tions of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point himself exactly .
less than a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the outside installations are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a patio there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russian Aff@@ air : us Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with reference to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper considered the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there were already first invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for quite some time to have targeted action in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the investigations should include several men who acted as consultants of the Republi@@ can in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports Mu@@ eller also examined more and more dr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved to the centre and sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ised the accus@@ ation as to whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible break@@ downs and to decide if charges are to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Ank@@ le Cham@@ bers .
most of the time they are turned on when they are bigger and controversial .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel may also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to be inter@@ ro@@ gated under oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also talking with him .
on Thursday evening , legal experts told us that the introduction showed that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the introduction of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russian affair as a campaign for its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House answers any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I leader James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this discharge , accus@@ ations against dr@@ unk@@ enness had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June to a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether to let Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller be released .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later res@@ cu@@ ed President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ c@@ tica a giant ic@@ e@@ berg has detached itself from the Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n@@ berg by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to human beings .
according to the researcher &apos;s data , to what extent climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , for around 30 years there have been a series of unusual occur@@ ren@@ ces of gel@@ ging in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n@@ ly .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and periodic@@ ally breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and abor@@ tions was disturbed a few years ago .
A@@ WI researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete batch file there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n@@ ly is in danger , as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be dis@@ integrated if a piece is broken down at a key position .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the recordings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is disputed among scientists whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n@@ ly will grow back or merge in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague , Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even though these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the polar bears of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long stretch of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in the direction of South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , thus counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f in the personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employer to step out of the employer &apos;s association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration have penet@@ rated .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the administrative office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first day of work behind them .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places that were to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ an@@ cies in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers are sought , as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the parties &quot; wish , the administration is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for human resources development and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs in skilled workers but to counter@@ act the trend towards candidate scar@@ city .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself in@@ wards and out@@ wards , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know earlier .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is governed by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this involves a high number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age .
take maximum time for action so that not even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .
he had long since taken care of a bad surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cap and ba@@ ff@@ led the remaining parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at a suitable solution at short notice , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials much better than it actually envis@@ ages the public service tari@@ ff .
the sal@@ aries are , at present , exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only possible if you change to a higher level , which is oriented to career years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Save &apos; because their team had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express himself on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all alleg@@ ations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Save &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that its crew takes on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim , in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed br@@ ine in the air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neu@@ stadt was ste@@ ered .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ li@@ ga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium at wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognized this .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports Department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still many clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the former coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now discussing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ li@@ gam@@ ann to Asia .
what is it about ?
in e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just football simulation FIFA will be challenged at competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asia @-@ 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and quick re@@ activity .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
that is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga .
however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; says Del@@ o@@ itte .
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting service Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe , too , things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ l .
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , football @-@ premi@@ er clubs are obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that only football remains as it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns the lyrics by Con@@ rad Roy for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years , because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until calling .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret completely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t smo@@ ther the loss of my beloved Son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s wedding , or would be an aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have the only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hop on , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said in several news she sent before his death in the two weeks , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
FC Bayern th@@ rows a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - no extra motivation is damaging there .
anything was different on its place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made a tie at his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavarian Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i also could interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holiday .
sugar is distributed as a favorite to those with a lot of confidence to keep you in a good mood .
those who were chosen to compete with the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame across the field .
right back , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on his arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal makes it possible to re@@ play his missing fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , to kno@@ ck out de@@ vil@@ s to the achievements of the Asian trip ( worked out only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver with them not to fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s jer@@ sey .
all at all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ ver was running beside Kim@@ che , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried successful in the construction of the game for a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mod@@ al shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was picked up for this style too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavarian world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection with the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but had six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to some ch@@ attering statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believed in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller spoke about Twitter just before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavarian @-@ Legi@@ onn@@ aire is a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and is be@@ fie@@ dert with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ ets of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sp@@ lash .
our ladies may need the famous Bavarian du@@ el well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises wis@@ sings pace
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand for a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ u , Chairman of the Association of Trier enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest turning point sees Nat@@ u in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes to establish a planning recruitment procedure until 2021 is expected to be the right to construction .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the v@@ est circum@@ vention of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Dr. Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Industry and Commerce ) Trier is aiming , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports declined for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , die I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the passing of the Master &apos;s exam and 2,500 euros if the graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the master &apos;s education .
the home@@ work list for the country is however long .
there are quick facts about the planned road construction , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at regional business .
the Chamber of Commerce ur@@ ges to give more orders to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country will invest more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ u is also expecting a country &apos;s concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the old broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she already cleared the field for dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW pres@@ i@@ dium said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers to install machinery for neutr@@ alizing exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of c@@ lan@@ cing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los bu@@ sters and laugh@@ ing against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most popular carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ ises of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still standing and working on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he was , among other things , a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still working on the drawing table today , works daily for almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ us@@ hes and watches continue to find its dro@@ pp@@ le characters a lot of dis@@ semination worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ th as a counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come into the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is shr@@ inking because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases affecting scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year .
Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ ning point is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age fest .
Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , Vag@@ aries or a landing camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce employees are usually meeting Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal pain suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wearing t @-@ shirts , showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with the thousands of mor@@ den linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we are suspi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and fired 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields as rival fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the poison @-@ poison @-@ problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved being able to publish extremely accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez also won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it went .
he volunte@@ ered to be sc@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what happened ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was flu@@ ffy like a harbour worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine work ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
the anger is , the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it was known that Spyware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has made three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , performing a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months before , readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication have been broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped some notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist as the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country journalists have become more ph@@ one@@ tic by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international assistance to the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking sc@@ ares him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved d@@ anced din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
Sha@@ wn Funk was found on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soils .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link a little with your eyes , you can almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature was to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a walking tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to ming@@ le better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours covering it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen paved the way for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by eating din@@ osau@@ rs sufficient pressure by eating meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on its life , including its con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , was caught in a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea on his back .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved ch@@ apped skin , but also stays in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only sleep a little bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the retained din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that raised from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was flo@@ ated by Western Canada until a flooded river flows into the open sea .
but the cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin @-@ branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remain@@ ders of the skin still cover the hol@@ ly ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers long st@@ out and g@@ aff .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , between the inter@@ connecting offices of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) around 17.00 hrs ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
there was no information about the exact number of injured parties .
it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re return jam was formed in the direction of travel in Munich .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , it also occurred on the reverse track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you sit in the train and sleep .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uncomfortable or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken his place and vali@@ date the ticket .
at the moment , a test operation is running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the road map de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; .
a button for the electronic evaluation will appear in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket check in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel safely without ticket inspection by our train crew , simply check in the DB Navigator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket checks belong to the biggest nu@@ is@@ ance .
because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other net numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rec@@ ited on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she moved her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police tape and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be a Brow@@ ns father who bore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have got used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened during the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance , which exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had on the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter stayed with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Fair@@ y Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors , during an evening demonstration .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said that they and their c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
one question came to his mind : &quot; do you want to document or attempt to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ k@@ ic in@@ mates .
Fer@@ rel@@ l drew his commitment to the project , along with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; took place in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for this is how I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is not a mes@@ si@@ ah guide , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the whole movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must carry the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook that energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , even though she was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the telecommunications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and feels obliged to this memory , since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV viewers discuss bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bit @-@ Gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but since the first presentation in 2009 , the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian area divi@@ des the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
the theme hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; needs no human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
added : the gallery is plan@@ ed exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
with the start of construction work will be finished .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the shopping paradise in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the local rentals are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a shame that special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost Bit @-@ Galerie already manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I can find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ op@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year sentence after having published diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and De@@ dic@@ ated Dis@@ si@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg lived through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal ne@@ ph@@ ew @-@ dogs , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic called &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who predicted a future in which the President would convert Over@@ seas Jud@@ gment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome form of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ are the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endow@@ ed with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , of which gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , are also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she goes hand @-@ in @-@ hand with a hands @-@ free phone from the United States disciplinary st@@ alli@@ ons like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they make your speech cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never hold your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which come together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , showing the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the scene of events , and det@@ ec@@ tives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ db , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ db . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago &apos;s Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly encouraged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic hint that said something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA Road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA Road@@ map , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged nation@@ ally supported dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has caused an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v introduced problems of the past to Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these were shared by the company groups .
it was a matter of precau@@ tion that it could further be assumed that no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to make clear and transparent with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next competi@@ tor
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees on your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers show low approval results - so that you can drill up why .
companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
over the years , u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report poor behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way of pursuing the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers , which were sitting in offices in cities or states , can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and the commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies very much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees will wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed time plans of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
20 exercises before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plot on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been planted with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net beyond a goal post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire themselves to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much for that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fac@@ tual verification in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fac@@ t@@ als and then display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false al@@ erts and to send them to fac@@ t@@ reviews , which may display results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan for the social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by fac@@ et reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Tur@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Man &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the im@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his im@@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ stated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape nur@@ ses , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who had something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all of it ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history on a wider basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be quite cro@@ o@@ ks , always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise within . &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle Rho@@ des is in search of other unique scre@@ ams experiences
he has placed a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf conc@@ eals
with the opening of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August , there should be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
in fact , we firmly believe that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , it is in competition with other municipalities .
the new umbrella brand and the campaign will cost the city of Bad Honne@@ f with an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officers cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Minister also participated in the discussions .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government re@@ ins the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the Navy were de@@ posed .
since the failure of the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a clin@@ ker of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the prohibition of women for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the army and the security forces continue to work with the army and the security forces .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing more 7@@ 3@@ 95 civilians per decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they were challenged to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tr@@ ump said , cited by the media .
it fores@@ ees to reduce the legal migrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining a visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the United States will change the way citizens from other countries are spending Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for the shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the platform shuttle has been fought over and over again - now it &apos;s supposed to go very fast .
before the end of the year , on the ailing route , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the route will begin this year in order to secure the future of the ticket system in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g track , the country is comm@@ itting itself to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus Flor@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country receives 75 percent .
the contract , upon which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently defini@@ tively adjusted , declared at@@ oning .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia Rail@@ ways as operators already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded expi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially for tourists .
during the course of a pilot operation in recent months , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future .
in addition , the route is severely reduced in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not become even more crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when publishing his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it will be more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects associated with this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if one goes one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah to worry a most .
true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared to a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something more ha@@ zy and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R as@@ signs their increasing popularity , they remain in the br@@ ink of consumer culture for the time being .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with por@@ no@@ graphic proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are false slaves .
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ er of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US voters will also have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of drinking relatives .
we are all struggling to make our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics suddenly and very stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by the jump , but the dis@@ car@@ ding effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gro@@ unded possibility that one day his mist@@ resses will no longer meet us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which the ump re@@ public@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be very mild off@@ ences .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are obst@@ inate and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the them@@ ed pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el still has a strange magical experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but thank@@ fully nobody asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , in a department store , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually is a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , shooting them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ thous@@ anders from F@@ av@@ kin and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der elected a young Eagle growing in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken breeding a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken ; the eagle lifted up his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat who carried the cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for the integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ lei@@ rider An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ man that he felt accepted in his new school .
thanks @-@ to @-@ word to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps in with instruc@@ tional tours , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time was over , the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher rec@@ alled .
after two years of teaching , she was very reluc@@ tant to leave school because it had been a really great time .
in the end , they have been able to rely on the fourth @-@ wat@@ chers .
finally , all students recorded a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ class vessels have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia the police arrested a group of illegal persons , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place every one found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspections are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must Diesel drivers take part in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estim@@ ations :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting was ordered by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their framework .
how long should the conver@@ sions go altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW corporation ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , according to S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is so far no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE reveals to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that he would refra@@ in from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and it bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center named after former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , reti@@ res next year .
the job is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city building master for the past 31 years .
and the work is still fun for him , as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports about varied but demanding tasks await his success@@ ors .
at the same time , he is surprised that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach is acting as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must instruc@@ t corresponding agreements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill them any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the public and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have been initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will book with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master there is great scope for design .
with Has@@ la@@ x &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city engineer stresses .
in any case , the city building master is responsible for a high degree of responsibility .
he is a client , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor to stay for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to the city of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to be buried in Roland W@@ acker should have a degree in degree in architecture or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management planning , estate management , management of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening , as well as Lower Building Law , including conservation of monuments .
bicycle thrown on lines : Süd@@ bahn rail@@ road closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for them since the night hours .
near the scene there were witnessed by witnesses a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have put himself in great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail transport , even sponsors of the railway @-@ customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to be expected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be managed without disabilities .
almost ten passenger flights were cancelled on Friday morning , two of them considered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they were late .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourage more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system is also in people .
post@@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been separated , did not .
they presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. crosses in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han supplements from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , having signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed with the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ching at will .
however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started to compete in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ up XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new duties , but he insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind revers@@ ed : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only there was no head@@ fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has radic@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with growing horror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep set@@ backs .
one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green is simply not reliable to go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional issue of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apost@@ ate Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and election campaign manager of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , Minister @-@ President of Lower Saxony , is there after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down at the time of the comrades .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was it - and it was all distinc@@ tly worse .
the defeat in Kiel took the SPD in a stag@@ ger position , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf poll@@ s ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades had lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD deputy , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the communication of crisis , which could be done wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz struggles for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW Ex@@ hau@@ st System and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ising for some time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain concealed in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite might occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony .
and Martin wasn &apos;t at all at all .
at the moment , comrades , therefore , make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger depends on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ life@@ jackets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ life@@ jackets provides her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary faction , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ life@@ jackets was not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but was elected to the Parliament by the state list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary faction , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the welcome game four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who holds the Lower Saxony SD@@ P as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for town core III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get assistance from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday informed them in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what has been happening .
since 1991 , there have been in @-@ depth rehabilitation areas .
back then , in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renovation projects are a &quot; successful project &quot; - finally , it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new fields of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s feelings .
how does a rehabilitation zone develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to study Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role whether there is interest in the planned area at all to be rehabil@@ itated .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could shift again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; within which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would finally be defined as a by@@ laws .
the grant period for funding has been ongoing since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the survey would take place only once , in the framework of which the participants in the renovation area receive a questionnaire .
in November or December , as soon as possible , the decree order should be carried out so that in the coming year it is possible to begin with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned pre @-@ examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban issues and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for each plot there will be a re@@ mark in the land register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to me again and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property B@@ ow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it deals among other things about the structural condition and the restructuring intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray frame , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing arch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and inhabitants of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if there are business premises in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - first comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come to house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology is similar to a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn Airport for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax pay@@ ers according to the military reported to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice @-@ president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his supervis@@ or , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the security guards stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to reduce government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation , when the presidential plane in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , served taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 caused 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters flew additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether he inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
at the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to Si@@ kor@@ sky &apos;s representatives and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the Table Third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite after five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has received the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has in any case respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup assignments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ kam@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting tough for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue and white could give Max Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is active at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not eligible for the Bundes@@ li@@ ga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament will be the first to play this season .
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ gor@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the White rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Ch@@ us@@ z could once again join the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ station to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills up the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the U.S. offensive .
after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , who jointly with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Sou@@ ls Nord Stream 2 .
the threat is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the group could refuse and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t gone by for a long time .
the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first got its first trailer and showed the newest gu@@ sts of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commanded the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
role in reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table by itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centers , the clock is revers@@ ed .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own shel@@ tered bay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continues to be cooked except the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh Gek@@ o cooled .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
in the past year of kit@@ esur@@ fing there were 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita have lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service when children are up to 2 pm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time professionals have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , rinse off , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are double @-@ group@@ ed as well as sev@@ ent@@ een units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm which they found in the cost comparison between self @-@ directing and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it is called the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time employees are recru@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with around 750 people in the area of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate without restriction and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghanistan &apos;s elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully to the next democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
then one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , but they failed .
without prey the duo escaped .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers have long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The company has been silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a fl@@ ori@@ zing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last night , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar following an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for $ 89 million .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar conquered his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insist@@ ed that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , that will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has intentionally over@@ turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld Street in front of the estate number 30 and thus attacked property damage of more than € 200 on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police witnessed an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old retired from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 7.@@ 55 o &apos;clock on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au &apos;s b@@ ypass , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to reti@@ re to the right .
the tour operator tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on the passenger car , property damage was created .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it may be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police therefore asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the responsible vehicle to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au below Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report reli@@ eves the pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the strain of Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ aci@@ ated Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deepest regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events at that time .
on the other hand , the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the domain cats is measured with &quot; two measures . &quot;
with regard to the interference in Regensburg , no one doubt that it should be a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act , &quot; which would have to be punished and avoided in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ da@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we love to go to church and that &apos;s a bound food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger frequently appeared .
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber appointed by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the enligh@@ tenment ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( &quot; High P@@ lau@@ sibility &quot; ) victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students was even more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger looks after his opinion .
Mr. H@@ atz@@ inger , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of non @-@ violence in Schutz@@ t@@ ohl@@ enen in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more hand@@ gr@@ en@@ sible to the ec@@ ologically , when a domain atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all present in it .
it is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to blame it , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he appeared , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also led to flood bro@@ therhood .
that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor , but also distributed cat@@ ches and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period of the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a secular school , a gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the pre @-@ school , they are , of course , bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it &apos;s not about his reputation and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just rus@@ hed on him .
many who have never understood him are still working dili@@ gently at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also exposed to any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Choir Master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the sad@@ mins on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims remain silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who had been professionally conscientious obj@@ ected to a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the cats and cats of R@@ atz@@ inger judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ben ever more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , teachers of trust , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that affected students and / or their surroundings had confidence in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to talk about any complic@@ ity .
it can also not be accused of preventing it or bringing it to the display .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these re@@ pu@@ gn@@ ant crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly the abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation between the primary school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cats , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were literally har@@ assed and mal@@ treated , and suffered terri@@ bly , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions prevailed .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the cathedral school gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ esh@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
in this way , at most , it remains the reproach to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states of the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the operations at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael H@@ esh@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test punishment was banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows still .
it was difficult to assess for him , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
it was only in 1980 that schools were officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ esh@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of ass@@ essing the past after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the primary school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. cat@@ er@@ pillars and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing a language ?
Michael H@@ esh@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
nevertheless , I do not at all fail to admit that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this must also be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world tran@@ ce from the rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys don &apos;t even make a great singer and stand before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations about her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply dis@@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only hurt a fly .
I regularly receive how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen houses still today , 23 years after his é@@ ration , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ies are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to whom she still looks and ad@@ ore them .
and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is most un@@ just to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that was just published reli@@ eves it .
now the state of the estate would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without whom nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen near Bavaria and probably Germany , finally to let him in peace .
