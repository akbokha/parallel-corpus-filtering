<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich favours exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork that one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called original positions, were incorporated into the large picture map for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally departing with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, they were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV promoted the project further, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau," "" "and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original document for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library like all others.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison In the morning is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated into the Munich suburb 21 years after the map was created, so in 1877.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbering pieces from the so-called "primal reception" from which the basic tax was deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" "" "land in the sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the location of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there, in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based" "" "Circle of Errents" "" "was created" "" "On the Auer Lüft." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbidden the staff to force violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was space for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenburg, which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second suburban railway line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen's Rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Fares has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28th, 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel by the state and take extreme caution because a number of dubious, racial-based occurrences occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discriminatory suits, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities who are disproportionate to minorities, urged the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sander died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state will be kept 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring in chewing money or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classify the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws banning local law enforcement agencies, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further racial profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">A fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher Weidezvn" "" "project is a success project and will be continued next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the 'Fischbacher CDU-localities' meeting with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the headquarters of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "black-white milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales arrive at the table of the Feriengaste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the" "" "elementary importance" "" "project as" "" "elementary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, and much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader's funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of the promotion, farmers often stand in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance area is 40 hectares, which may not be rebrated until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also said: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The county-care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state promotion of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveying capacity marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed must not be tractor-able (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 fishing pond project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the most carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the suggestions of the president on drastic limitation of legal immigration into the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on its importance, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta bypassed: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, the miserable apostasy of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their words after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fanciful fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black raises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the Director of Performance of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championships" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out," "" "Black said." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir mon Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their Captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships with the 400 m hurdles, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-haul runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also join the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics about Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't use the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long before newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked in the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained of it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "many people said." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to depress his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the governors side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who wave the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical dead bodies or arrest demonstrators and silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what's happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County violated First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable servings had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writer beat on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that settled Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his post, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>

<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily arrested, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>

<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's campaign to highlight the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unsettled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmantha Nasir, recalled the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">People on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered belatedly that they were mistaken for firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people, which was conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Among those surveyed admitted that they have knowingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that have been purposely passed along to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent stated knowingly having carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods had brought by airport security and how many had deliberately done it.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to use the huge number of prepositions for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">So far, he has underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's chief Elon Musk reveals another, less glittering number for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits that 63,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 such non-binding reservations pledge, musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models are expected to be - 500,000, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently being made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines not yet tested in practice without bigger interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If it comes to major delays, then the non-binding reservation could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in flocks.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented change as its agency reacted to the needs of state environmental authorities more quickly than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline that expired on October 1, in order to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt declared in June that he would delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecuted by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma for a long time, was a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been persuaded to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies obliged to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruten suggested that his reversal in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who complained more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority it gives us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "however, the Opinion of the EPO has said that Pruitt will eventually use its" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" "" "to ensure that the provisions are based on solid politics and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not set up in the Senate yet.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States, who had sued EPA in this week, said the group wanted to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their congregations," "" "said Schneiderman."

<seg id="460">Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="461">The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius area is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumultuous for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer urn book: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen including the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumble mountain apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patronate was owned and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people lived there as well.</seg>
<seg id="474">As deriving from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are now still visible in the town's image of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" is the third, the dominating village centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 reflect these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the Early Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two was destroyed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present Turmzwerg remains a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wem take care of the" "" "Schaffhausen retirees" "" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumbagens on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is starting at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade there is a trunk outside the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers discover the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hilarius area, which is of great importance for tumors and hearing-makers.</seg>
<seg id="503">Friends and sponsors are particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim" "" "does not see any legal requirements for construction and therefore has turned to the councils." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the" "" "Boisheim" "" "association has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been authorised, since at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones will prevent the landscape from being" "" "thrifty" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had agreed a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier by a change in the land partition plan - but that had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a malfunction.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval letter is still unlawful and therefore to be taken back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "with this, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reasoning of the organisation" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen Township gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to lure the residents to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers the own city holds apart from the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic firms should present themselves with their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">"" "in addition, the shops of the city center will invite you to" "" "MitterNight Shopping" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="538">The action is aimed not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region.</seg>

<seg id="540">City administration and commercial association co-operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings, such as the first "active day" for well-being and selling Sunday, talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many local people lost sight of the city centre when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had spread in part, king had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that in Germany's third "home-shopping" day, five Thuringian cities are taking part for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max Quantity works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">During their voluntary year they work in several places.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I finished school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer's degree, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realised for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point perhaps, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I'm going to study dual, probably make a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and I'm studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where you are doing your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all aspects of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">It was very varied with me.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs off.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Amount: well, here it's not about calculating static statistics.</seg>
<seg id="710">One always has other people upside down, each having a very different story behind each other.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal individually with it.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have any reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Amount: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives you a lot.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Finance rules of football impact on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending on European football clubs will not bother Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) in order to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose so that Neymar will sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich herdsman family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to counteract legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from the concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the current three-year period of the FFP subscription period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the account statement over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenue can be expelled for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered to be legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments could come to Neymar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 demonstrated that Neymar WM will be ambassador and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to bypass the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated revenue of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sale.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was unequivocally confused to see one of the best football players and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-years-Grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Showalter the sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first day of camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By fermenting themselves at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who are grown up - they nevertheless created the impossibility to regain the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults playing an adult now, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the watering can principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy guy called Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"" "it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons" "" "Singles" "", "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of random delusion that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West-West ringfight iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finding the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" engages itself so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy isn't fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "comrade Detective" "" "who was rearranged to a smaller length could better deliver his Agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself to Earls Court Apartment in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne closet and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Not only was it possible to build a simple platform, but to place the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is so important that if you push the door, it is very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create emotional ties in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly by default into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate empire Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "after an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as" "" "main operator and the dominant personality" "" "described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin property has a value of $316 million and a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul states, has excluded it.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with affirmdavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy farms and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansladen with the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that comes into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said Sam Nunberg's former election campaign against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would not have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience anything about the tweets that have not sent trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his colleagues managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from encouraging drumps controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting pumping material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that trump cards like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassings or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, received the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is surrounded by the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Due to the closure of the Birkenhof by the then ambiance operating company ltd. to 13 April 2014 about 30,000 Nights per year were lost and also receipts from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as collective housing for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed at the time of the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for some time now, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's really a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1466">"" "" "" "we want to make a gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">The swimming pool, the wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not wish to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already on a high-scale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1472">The notions of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint himself exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Less than a million euros, he calculates.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outside installations are also placed on the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russian Affair: us Special Intermediator Announces Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "over the past few weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "with reference to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for quite some time to have targeted action in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trumps's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"" "" "" "the focus of the investigations should include several men who acted as consultants of the Republican in the election campaign." ""</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also examined more and more drumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump had personally moved to the centre and scrutinised the accusation as to whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible breakdowns and to decide if charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called Ankle Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when they are bigger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel may also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to be interrogated under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps's consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign director Paul Manafort were also talking with him.</seg>
<seg id="1498">On Thursday evening, legal experts told us that the introduction showed that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign for its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House answers any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this discharge, accusations against drunkenness had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June to a senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether to let Trump Mueller be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later rescued President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the insistence of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the special promoter could no longer be released so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C Schelsolemnly.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and periodically breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelsolems lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe the equilibrium of waxes and abortions was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researchers Daniela Jansen writes a complete batch file there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelsolemnly is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be disintegrated if a piece is broken down at a key position.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelsolems is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the recordings," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">It is disputed among scientists whether the Larsen-C Schelsolemnly will grow back or merge in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague, Adrian Luckman, and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the polar bears of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stretch of Antarctica extends in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, thus counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif in the personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employer to step out of the employer's association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new places in the administration have penetrated.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the administrative office in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places that were to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacancies in the circle of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers are sought, as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG together with the FDP and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "after the parties" wish, the administration is said to "" "" develop a concept for human resources development and personnel development. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs in skilled workers but to counteract the trend towards candidate scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is governed by a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not arrive at a suitable solution at short notice, the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a tariff," "" "said people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">This means that the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials much better than it actually envisages the public service tariff.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are, at present, exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only possible if you change to a higher level, which is oriented to career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Save' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express himself on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascensions and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Outer" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim, in the northern Palatinate, to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There followed lookout points, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout point at the lookout point, connected by "flew" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled brine in the air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was steered.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating through the stadium at wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first Bundesligavereine, who are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognized this.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports Department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-old that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundesligamann to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just football simulation FIFA will be challenged at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asia-2022 e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities need cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and quick reactivity.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobous also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the road internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "says Deloitte.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is shrinking because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases affecting scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And it's much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">Weekly Riodoce employees are usually meeting Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal pain suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing t-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010 a special prosecutor's office was established in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the thousands of morden linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why we are suspicious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and fired 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "Twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the poison-poison-problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved being able to publish extremely accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez also won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be scared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what happened?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was fluffy like a harbour worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for routine work?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it was known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures focused on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, performing a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "in the past we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication have been broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was turned into storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped some notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist as the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become more phonetic by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international assistance to the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua, after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved state has astounded researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">Shawn Funk was found on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soils.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink a little with your eyes, you can almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a walking tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to mingle better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen paved the way for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by eating dinosaurs sufficient pressure by eating meat eating dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been to the Cretaceous period," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on its life, including its conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was caught in a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea on his back.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and mummified in mud.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>

<seg id="1976">There was no information about the exact number of injured parties.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one's ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2059">Folayan said that they and their cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to his mind: "do you want to document or attempt to find a story that you can use?"</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuopern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst banned a 35-year sentence after having published diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and Dedicated Dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg lived through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal nephew-dogs, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic called "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future in which the President would convert Overseas Judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome form of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further flare the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, of which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, are also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees on your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is at waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, provide employees anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers show low approval results - so that you can drill up why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Over the years, uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report poor behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has grasped regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves inethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way of pursuing the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers, which were sitting in offices in cities or states, can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and the commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies very much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Turiewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the imprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double-agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his imprint!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were itself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overstated my welcome greeting") all this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all of it! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "Rhodes says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are interconnected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen appeared to be quite crooks, always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not become even more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey when publishing his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his convictions, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">"" "and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" "" "Frigid Farrah" "", "which gives the impression of shyness and" "" "Wild Wendy" "" "with an" "" "adventurous" "" "personality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects associated with this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape if one goes one step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah to worry a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True companion Roxxxy was compared to a vibrator on his website, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and their increasing refinement point to something more hazy and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR assigns their increasing popularity, they remain in the brink of consumer culture for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires out of the fringes can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stoched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (though with pornographic proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are false slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truer of the trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters will also have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of drinking relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all struggling to make our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-minded poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics suddenly and very strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by the jump, but the discarding effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk about" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the grounded possibility that one day his mistresses will no longer meet us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which the ump republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are obstinate and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perspiring music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel still has a strange magical experience, as two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but thankfully nobody asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually is a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I wearied the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>

<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecutor's Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but demanding tasks await his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must instruct corresponding agreements.</seg>

<seg id="2558">In any case, the city building master is responsible for a high degree of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a client, "in the end everything runs over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination he can count on many years of co-operation: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2583">Researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>

<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tryptophan encourage more tolerant, less inflammatory bowmilieus if the same system is also in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. crosses in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan supplements from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidency Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest of the municipality's feelings.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, as soon as possible, the decree order should be carried out so that in the coming year it is possible to begin with the restructurings.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, vice-president Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar following an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the past season for $89 million.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about how Neymar conquered his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insisted that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2879">The police witnessed an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2880">Because he had a car in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening the 34-year-old retired from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 o'clock on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of Stolzenau's bypass, a passenger car came to meet him in his lane, so that he had to retire to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The tour operator toured the crash barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2884">On the passenger car, property damage was created.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident, it may be good that the Mercedesdriver did not notice the accident at all.</seg>

<seg id="2888">"" "interview:" "" "Domspatzen" "" "report relieves the pope brother Georg Ratzinger" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves the strain of Pope John Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication against the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emaciated Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deepest regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the events at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that reporting on violence in the domain cats is measured with "two measures."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the interference in Regensburg, no one doubt that it should be a "shameful and shameful act," which would have to be punished and avoided in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, "said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scardaia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we love to go to church and that's a bound food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a very normal educational tool" "" "had been," "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, pope brother Georg Ratzinger frequently appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored Ratzinger's "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber appointed by the diocese of Regensburg with the enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen ("High Plausibility") victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen, were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality the punishment for the students was even more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger looks after his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hatzinger, the 440-page report on the "incidents of non-violence in Schutztohlenen in the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became more handgrensible to the ecologically, when a domain atz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to blame it, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatz" "" "gymnasium, on which he appeared, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also led to flood brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't just pop with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor, but also distributed catches and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period of the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the pre-school, they are, of course, bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it's not about his reputation and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also exposed to any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Choir Master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of the sadmins on behalf of the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who had been professionally conscientious objected to a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cats and cats of Ratzinger judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd, to assume that... Buben ever more intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, teachers of trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "the fact that affected students and / or their surroundings had confidence in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to talk about any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It can also not be accused of preventing it or bringing it to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former mayor Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hatzinger: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation between the primary school and the gymnasium of the cats, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadist teachers were literally harassed and maltreated, and suffered terribly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the cathedral school gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject" "" "primary school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Heshemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at most, it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states of the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the operations at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Heshemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the preschool the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test punishment was banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to assess for him, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Heshemann:" "" "we historians speak of the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of assessing the past after today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not for what was breached in the primary school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. caterpillars and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Heshemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all fail to admit that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world trance from the rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys don't even make a great singer and stand before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzinger: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply disbelieving and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive how many former Domspatzen houses still today, 23 years after his ération, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspies are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom she still looks and adore them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just published relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of the estate would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without whom nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen near Bavaria and probably Germany, finally to let him in peace.</seg>
