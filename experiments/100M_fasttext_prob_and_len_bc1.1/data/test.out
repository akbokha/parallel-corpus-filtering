28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and that the investigation was at work .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , won his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the spokes@@ man .
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia suggested that Frank first lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to combine his style with his family was to always cook us something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the sign telephone of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside labels which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather slu@@ gg@@ ish for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of tel@@ ev@@ isions with loose di@@ ble and Mexican food , it is written in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to White Gl@@ ory , she asks for the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : golden sports pyramid for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted at home in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilomet@@ re at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself be led with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed the man from An@@ hausen into the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid as part of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British queen has already ad@@ jour@@ ned him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for athle@@ tic achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the fen@@ c@@ ers Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
according to the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza award went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policies compared : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
the role of the state .
jump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive regulations massive , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in which must be invested , tr@@ ump and Clinton speak almost elo@@ qu@@ ently .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be internal party discussions at Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious .
tr@@ ump aims to build coal @-@ fired power plants and ramp up coal mining in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ative trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what dr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , there is a ump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics believe him , so that the budget deficit would only increase .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged women has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house provides shelter .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he curi@@ ously looks into the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene is normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs initiated the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - neither as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons prevail : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are ste@@ aling away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their native country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the escape , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ g@@ boats require a sexual act for a bottle of water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
if you think that the end will be ir@@ re as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr tells us .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and badly ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich appreciate that they are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their competence , some answered with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is not such a thing in accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some community shel@@ ters or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is lacking or will men and women stay together , it can come to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read off by the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
assistance Physi@@ cians Con@@ strike : demands for New Work Camp@@ a@@ ig@@ ns
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , veter@@ in@@ arians and medical students voted on the refusal of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work @-@ fighting measures that began at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that veter@@ in@@ arians went on strike this year six times , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of B@@ MA assistance physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistants and medical students , stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gil@@ ded audi@@ torium of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I can &apos;t deny that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked delic@@ ately and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to imply the opposite .
but a sustainable ch@@ illed out of Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the launching of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time had been kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was done by a supposed friend .
building up the can@@ ine will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first of all needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal assault on the Mediterranean .
this week , state television approved cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who pi@@ cks up to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described me : two countries that are viol@@ ating and badly treated by the West , and now compos@@ ing themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand shall only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be res@@ cu@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the listing on stock exchange will change to Nat@@ al .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller stamps for retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we do not pursue any global goals , but local goals .
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori sp@@ ells champagne after a double at New@@ market , giving him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he seated on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ er when he ob@@ tains the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career positions
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey players in Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won nearly 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of British flat@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he was in trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his funeral .
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori himself once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed President Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust group for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Deputy Assistant , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the leader of the protocol and staff of the governing body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV channel that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov for a long time was one of the closest confi@@ den@@ ers Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at present .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president to re@@ direct Russian environmental policy - stum@@ bled upon great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , &quot; Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust a plac@@ id post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office as a third term would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination on the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been part of the series since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart &apos;s blood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore .
I would like to say thank you to the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series .
the scheduled radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth ech@@ el@@ ons is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around the fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that have been picked up by a fountain .
Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Kei@@ th Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete kiss to the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the south side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate since the tolerances that the team are working on were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at hit the Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat moving around and the worst occurred to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ at station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left the boat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the sea rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this caused the boat to loose from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
today someone has been watching over these men .
seriously injured - a man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police told me yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic drink dis@@ member@@ ed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when he came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called on his mother .
this then al@@ armed its sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother down .
she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life companion .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors are expected to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that in the next few years , Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose almost 1300 favourable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban surfaces must in future testify to 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
the big point of conten@@ tion in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but build as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and has to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er requirements for investors .
not@@ withstanding this , so Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is underway .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1300 beneficial apartments , whose promotion will be exp@@ elled in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , 500 dwell@@ ings will be available .
to prevent this from happening , the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the town .
in addition , it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to price .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines are running at the end of the year .
around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is further increased dramatically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; mixing &quot; .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , I concentrated on more buildings for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside for playing , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , was su@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players move outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographs &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the train and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who exercise 30 minutes every day , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; met de@@ af ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends during the hunt .
as always there are gr@@ ump@@ y per@@ ish@@ ers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
there has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track down our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ aged
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all along the line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ a@@ artist A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
Sim@@ one Bal@@ aam builds on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ fight event of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ o is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bal@@ aam has dominated the last three years , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight event of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ o won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as a ex@@ clamation mark on the good@@ bye ceremony of the retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insist@@ ed that during their long way to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which include her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will last for a long time as Bal@@ aam wants .
even though Must@@ afa was slightly led by two turns , the picture blur@@ red .
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bal@@ es holds the title of the World Championship - they were l@@ ur@@ king .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and sat on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old male @-@ collar , which is called by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her exercise , she threw out K@@ us@@ h@@ oos , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ o , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous fall of Phoenix , while staying in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand gun while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led investig@@ ators to take a closer look if they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months , and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting rel@@ ying on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing about during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course you have let yourself go on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been informed that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the aid of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t talk .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language called Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund found some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a multitude of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency state on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood boats , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had requested ten thousand sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it also ra@@ ined in the Mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge nearby .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the assigned rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still shr@@ unk people from flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she never saw such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that all three could have res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that due to rainf@@ all , the floor had been considerably balanced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching activities in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa caused 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed off by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ham@@ mond City of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood of water and sand sacks were provided for the inhabitants to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys told that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday are reported to have been reported as floo@@ ding , but on Friday no one has been reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched from bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several shooting injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital when he was transported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body has been ri@@ dd@@ led through balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z announced to the broad@@ ca@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ ca@@ ster that he is expected to recover .
he would have begun the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot on , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether there could be one of the wounded men of the offen@@ ders .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , j@@ umped into the scene .
it seems that this is definitely a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the way , there were sleeves .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were actively involved , &quot; police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di told the police in Philadelphia to the broad@@ ca@@ ster .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police were re@@ port@@ edly insp@@ ected according to reports the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross@@ wind on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to myself under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than a reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three female Tur@@ ner@@ ists , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ be , the Catho@@ lics , rounds off everybody .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an African @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic champion and America ju@@ bel@@ ted .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans , who won gold in an individual multi @-@ battle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see sne@@ akers in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a costly sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started their gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the churches out of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable Harlem for over 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to interest in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and than@@ king you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance Physi@@ cians would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted in a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to en@@ force the contract and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians are to receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekly calendar , in order to improve the maintenance of times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assistance physicians , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance Physi@@ cians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and arrange it to treat all physicians . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talks have been clas@@ sed by the government for the reluc@@ tance to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the necessity and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he should not do so , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in granting physicians on the right to strike .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to pay a better week@@ day compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything but over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only cares , hard@@ ships and dis@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of the Physi@@ cians and have responded favor@@ ably to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ stle with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , training cr@@ ates , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned about compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication after suggested by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation agency has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation agency has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots break , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the introduc@@ tory bill by N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often have disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to ignor@@ antly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally acc@@ uses the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes that ink cannot be removed to a person &apos;s finger when they vote for their vote to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ andal in East London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he particularly vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ code - the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the lead of ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it says , &quot; As proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have wit@@ t@@ ingly ignored such conduct because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric told 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process postal voting materials to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral cycle being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your card .
use non removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three year limitation on applications for an automatic post@@ code .
ban on political activists to process full letter elections and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ heads .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for elec@@ tive stations .
a change of the law , which facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally asser@@ t that voters go into the electoral cab alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ tive regi@@ ments of town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country as the mother of parliam@@ ents bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spreading of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games are advised by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T as an impressive double @-@ worker of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by no means the only ath@@ lete who is fighting for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one may believe the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the US crew in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star discre@@ t@@ ely similar , appeared .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big expressive eyes , is supposed to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as the Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption spectacle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another moderate comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet is thinking that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and died like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the race . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he released his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ m free @-@ style swimming costume .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought onboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as he called , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy stag@@ ger@@ 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , which made it possible for the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ col@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with many people talking to him
Twitter users didn &apos;t think back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # is disgu@@ ised .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ olog@@ ised for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy wording , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times to the people who responded to the emer@@ ald on Twitter
Scott Russ@@ el , a comment@@ ator , had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added an ap@@ ology to over 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . By@@ ron does what he said very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald himself ap@@ olog@@ ised in the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us turn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;

the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants .
to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage through and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .

a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even attempt to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , because she placed it on the shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to get back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to re@@ think that someone would take home pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and und@@ ressed her and not washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the cast line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat it with the knees into the bar and twist while the attack@@ er cri@@ bs against pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip , before they move backwards and turn the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ els his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British travel@@ er sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and th@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , came out of Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush with a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking out each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of de@@ activating the flush button of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily there was nothing left to leak , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to dish@@ washers from toilets , the task set his immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to live up to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test specimen showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its lumin@@ ometric time amounted to over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not check here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming sessions that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally use products that contain added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale Family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation Social Vacation Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their homes after del@@ oc@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ pic@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were covered with g@@ aping holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage sprinkl@@ ed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
they were torn in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past .
neighbours insist@@ ed that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called to the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ iled her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ u@@ sions were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were looking for no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since del@@ on@@ ization is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ oc@@ ulation on the ground .
workers of the house administration will now have to remove rub@@ b@@ ish mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ hi@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don earned a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial for@@ esi@@ ght .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation at Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will navigate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who would not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without blame , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the vac@@ ation@@ ers sp@@ ill when they began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ ent@@ abra@@ werke , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flying
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and so had to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet was a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility in the vicinity , but the air forces insist@@ ed that security at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so low as a result of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which narrow@@ ed his sight .

Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with cares about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup for@@ wards against the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play goes three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inners must refra@@ in from eating with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic Football Tournam@@ ent with Brazil .
in addition , he also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German experienced a bend in the knee during the training , which has been clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one for the past two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision on this matter so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other races ki@@ cked off .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co won &apos;t really convince him at the time of the 3 : 2 in the fast mo@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after prolon@@ gation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves to win the second triumph at the Super cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition so far .
Ma Long in an own league of table tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
the World Ran@@ king First won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als and the Olympic Games .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the olymp@@ ic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time outs , they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn to the grand@@ stand and left their shel@@ ters on their own in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches for my country here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I play for myself in the final , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said in a logical way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first sentence with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he set the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough stunning ball @-@ changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the match for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an inj@@ ected a ri@@ b injury , after that he was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis board Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump creates &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weakness to his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as much as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , of evangel@@ ical Christians asking for assistance in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his fault was wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media schol@@ ar .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were indic@@ ted by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC station , Tr@@ ump replied to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not sufficient for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , he added .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is supposed to have threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better survey .
instead of being able to strengthen the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress more strongly .
Olympic : three @-@ year sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt to sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ ze dop@@ ing in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had indicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported by the leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing control engineers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has investigated the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the outcome of the investigation and the following IO@@ C measures , IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as chief of mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship fourth over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tic leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was usually noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on African land before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
in consequence , the WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing drugs are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s .
last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli says the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for U.S. director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the d@@ ei@@ ties went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; says A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London got into an airplane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Russia &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge in the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton yet if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he would spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ per heroes of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ eck Calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from Old@@ school play@@ boys , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the Cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community pays off with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Nah@@ Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany comp@@ utes with tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers coming from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already passed Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds back months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the ei@@ ving put@@ sch still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks are added .
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even lets refugees receive refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the federal government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; position as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ oni@@ ans and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Nah@@ Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper on appeal to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already in front of the coup the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore just under 29 percent of all people recognized as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
there is no question of war , poverty , or lack of prospects in this survey .
the right to asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual pursu@@ its .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far it is not stupid : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t have to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate parts at the end , only to work lab@@ ori@@ ously .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final days of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern now has to pass a campaign scar@@ c@@ ely close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
what is exciting is how much territory breaks down Af@@ D and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign of election , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distributing ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now probably to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are in the right place at the wrong time .
Angela Merkel has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to a large @-@ scale documentary ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel once again from other corners of Germany .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you are clearing the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any presence in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village elders , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats recently compl@@ ained with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the day of the land .
they make a modern virtue out of their holiday need and make their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is the name of the pres@@ idents Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green ball@@ ots are going to search for local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ els just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there is all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff off the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south as planned at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ owed will also be the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ ess@@ entran@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been aboli@@ shed and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
as speed limits were not met , the congregation encouraged the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself able to speak about the situation .
two to three per minute have been bre@@ w@@ ed .
the fastest was at 77 km / h in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the street is open again for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to growth in turnover lets anyone you ask is able to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the refur@@ bish@@ ment hardly has consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travelling documentary is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales losses are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his collabor@@ ators .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts , where so much more generous is handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
finally , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars ignore less frequently due to complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
that his family @-@ client@@ ele returns to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal .
it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
according to the latest proposals , Home Affairs Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a large security package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ling Status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the shipping company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in presenting his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also che@@ ered on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère passed away a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère leaves a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck out jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still holds this for reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by the Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aching people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
he wants to make some worse for rejected asylum seek@@ ers than until now - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally delicate .
many things also have an unexpected effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to imagine that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
many people also worried about security in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply occupied did not allow themselves to be cl@@ inging out in election campaigns .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days there was a high level between the two parties .
only an avant @-@ garde argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister &apos;s Interior Minister , in which the principal leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also working here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
we fixed the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ open it .
and in the case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it is still necessary to show itself .
there &apos;s a lot of things in there , which could cause a conflict .
but even the SPD is currently attempting to profit itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sig@@ mar Gabriel is cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizing his willingness to talk and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet Volkswagen is still gli@@ mm@@ ing through .
despite diesel consumption , the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
in the recall action there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen starts to start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer is able to present a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was ailing predominantly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
head of the brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also bur@@ dened by the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected local brand of Lower Saxony continues to travel through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales station from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ating emission tests with a software .
in Germany alone VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the upgrade , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer asks the customer for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after the upgrade , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , there will be no wor@@ sen@@ ing and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , will come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in any other damage that has nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal , it comes to a breach of possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers the future for pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &apos; do not have to fear to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a penalty of 0.4 percent .
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than € 100,000 on checking or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will be 400 euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been keeping 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not de@@ value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , he is now going to bear the costs .
letting the cash simply sit in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry you alone , either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank fees , credit cards or bank transfers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay flat charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , to skip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ aven@@ ue men of men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers hold their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ ff@@ ing wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - Hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of app@@ en@@ dage of the plate revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ energ@@ an to realize that record shops offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients picked up the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone cases , from objects that wake up happy youth memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is something for me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ated from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ rank@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has almost a whole floor dedicated to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ tant Pop instead of experimental jazz tunes from the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but the psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been in business for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale .
it rather makes a window shopping than a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to mut@@ ate the pants @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not by st@@ rolling through plat@@ ter shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the rigid look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who rises above the shoulders of no susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais declared that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ f@@ ecture was argu@@ ing that these places were to be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would pose a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the government @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than to feed people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café , which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite the dis@@ appointment of the Olympics : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympics he didn &apos;t want to let himself get won by Tony Martin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really hard for me to comment on yesterday &apos;s timing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for compliance with speed limits .
however , a lasting mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as drive ban on time , lanes and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
to ensure that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also bul@@ let @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to indications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and has now also been used .
also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
the impressive performance of Britain in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday evening , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the glo@@ omy stadium here .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one br@@ ite will hang a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderfully and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce off from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB rarely touched the ball .
a terri@@ fic T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua turned a touch down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the whi@@ stle and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u stressed further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while G@@ GB is still learning .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB caused major changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half until Joshua passed through Fi@@ ji after a brilliant mid @-@ play .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left @-@ hand corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Se@@ aled @-@ Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked anni@@ hil@@ ly hit in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton pi@@ er@@ ced the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer to the rowing machine
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ thine gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ass@@ le that enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the two men sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when they followed the second Olympi@@ ad in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of the British sport who laid such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ 95 un@@ shot bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a contribution to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so soon I had to get better again .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ aking morning with it a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked as well .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years of clarity provided for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility company as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was said in the original sound in a contribution of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken appreciated the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Gruppe is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who spent 31 years in the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , including 28 years as managing director .
he has now retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approx . 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member churches are the municipalities of Kirch@@ loud , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and villages .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the &quot; Zw@@ eck@@ verband &quot; in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work over office and organizational activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has never been any down@@ time and again and again there have been new additions , because water means living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ expe@@ dient as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group on nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful k@@ not .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the con@@ co@@ ction .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe demoli@@ tion at the church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of brun@@ n could only be maintained , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility company was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succeeded following Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns herself to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight year old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now learn private in New York where there are the best therap@@ ists .

relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots to life companion
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured it mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us to have his life companion shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly tra@@ cked .
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brow@@ ned and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no statement about the death or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delic@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that threatened the branch of green electricity are from the table .
it remains in the release of the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for the so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ung ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told WA@@ Z , there is now a basic statement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the ste@@ el@@ works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent takes place .
but this too will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry were of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Stahl , Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weigh@@ ed in the reform of emissions trading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers made massive steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation was somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , suspended import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , economic prospects have risen in China .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated more .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced crowd went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an increase in order volume due to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp &apos;s entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir . in the teacher &apos;s degree course she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors league .
most senior citizens sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co@@ existence , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures often dissolve , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be stress@@ ful in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing this , senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of the powder as quickly as they are in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at an old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people who have denied themselves den@@ ounce long @-@ lying events .
in the case of singing , a special power is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
concentr@@ ating simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are doing so , not just concentr@@ ating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler recommends .
sing pra@@ ises the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect is the call of cat babies to adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ sts also did not leave the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the m@@ owing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to caus@@ tic caus@@ ae that are in great need , as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens differ with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
altogether nine adult males and eight female cats from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were pre @-@ played for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful ones .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned faster to the speaker when this cri@@ es of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas and Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already at the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the fall test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the coup attempt .
football is not stopped even before football .
against the former star @-@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar , the public prosec@@ utor made an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South kis@@ sed living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ ar is said to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into followers and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what unites the size of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially important for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
Cologne celebrated its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first game time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good@@ bye in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the season went better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 races of the season , laid the basis for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ scor@@ er @-@ King .
this is also the reason that fans hope to continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of the coup attempt at AC Florence , he had announced that he had only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return to his European holiday because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ man Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it would have to be ready to give up about a third of its annual salary , estimated at 7.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man realized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still med@@ als chances at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they are fighting for med@@ als in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian float , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was pi@@ ped out and rested with mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal setting : with an enligh@@ tened smile she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when she said that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience broke out in a che@@ ering tower .
but there are still many other athletes competing in the Rio Olympics despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to shut down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive intake and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold@@ fin@@ is@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement has been responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete , so many med@@ als were subsequently recognised .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling from the International Court of Sports , CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world champion and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 year @-@ old world champion , clu@@ es were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) fell mild and was already running on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , be still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two le@@ aps went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
in the morning a bomb explosion was reported from Ph@@ u@@ ket .
the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers , was injured by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive set had gone into the air in front of the territorial police in a flower bed .
finally , there were several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; the bomb states bear the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ compl@@ i Fri@@ days early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - it is prob@@ able , however , about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police assisted their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the explosive bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel will be dis@@ cour@@ aged in these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this also gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the insur@@ rec@@ tionary rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stroke by a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Compl@@ aint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several national authorities , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority was closely aligned with the State Off@@ ices during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ tions Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to attract people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
that is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the significant increase in legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the suspect in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example by CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympics or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Rio de Janeiro summer games .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral interaction .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place in 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well @-@ known .
because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ est@@ yle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ba@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea swimming pool , when he had to compete alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of free @-@ standing .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ba@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympics for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

dr@@ ump is not so close to the threat of electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks about a campaign event in Florida .
should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already made an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not sufficient for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , however , more and more resistance was emerging .
mail enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle by Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail is planning to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they are to deliver their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always ques@@ tioning , about by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and made a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we move around the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active in Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership replaces dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return appearances came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five in the sector faces a new beginning .
the board of directors wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Grin@@ ert has already been exp@@ elled from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Executive Board will take over the former Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ tas@@ k@@ inger as early as September 1 , announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ Kreis , on Friday , the shareholders were at the end of the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would be the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of loss even in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter mainly bur@@ dened the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the group sales of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , posted a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros under the balance sheet .
the Gf@@ K still generated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
in case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , told the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her instructions , had to avoid a vice that was partly on the reverse track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokesperson of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ finished travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the tour company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ o 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ level calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ o will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach district office established that under@@ cover for these sewage treatment plants .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as business and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to resort deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee rises between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , surplus and under@@ cover from the previous calendar period are to be compensated .
Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities deal with relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer system , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculations period in all three plants not least due to their age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expendi@@ tures , a considerable amount was incurred .
the plant in Az@@ ores is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt also pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the waste water plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be recovered from the ground and at the pond settlement L@@ opp , after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses were the continued assistance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still far below the current level during the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water case in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; were fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment expenses , has been spar@@ ed the process .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long run according to Stein@@ häuser , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal sewage treatment association could not be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit of facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.8 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell for clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are lif@@ eli@@ ke , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
snap@@ sho@@ ot@@ ting filters have gone cri@@ tically in the past where they were accused of the app to propag@@ ate Black@@ face enhanced or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have turned the feature off .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as a cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filtering of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos have been widely spread that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and in@@ convenient . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very resili@@ ent Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreci@@ ating extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the settings practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a HR officer who focused on subordin@@ ated population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said she would let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and she added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &apos; .
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Com@@ mit@@ ment Committee , secret service committees and the military budget committee , reports about great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , typically obtained from high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , periodic@@ ally reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the mis@@ leading mistakes in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed contin@@ ous problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than it meets the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com citizen publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ l@@ ems could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command centers shifted intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life after it was shut down that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s general inspec@@ tor .
the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over@@ ly little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were in@@ gest@@ ed by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique of the secret information about the Islamic State commemor@@ ates feu@@ ds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s , commander Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Britain is ahead
one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed the strong Dutch woman a little longer to lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work area in London we now have .
we have been able to carry around the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door @-@ row in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand envelope .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and lu@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book one goal in each of the previous games so far .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and inevitable , a fur@@ ious relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the w@@ rist@@ band to float to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympics .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow there are the sports which are not universally recognised : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely noticed that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadian women for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear fitting for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a do@@ d@@ ging enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending swelling - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ erc@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic program , you will be judged according to the design , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further increased goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it &apos;s enough to even touch a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it is also what I feel a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly up again .
also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming for 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by obtaining and objec@@ ti@@ fying male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters have been killed during the clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen .
is Ethiopia currently going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses indicated that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia .
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ si@@ ghted election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been defeated more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why the feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of getting worse under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians insist@@ ed that they gathered so to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them inno@@ cu@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to analysts , had apparently been fal@@ si@@ fied by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing raid many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but apparently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred for the Tig@@ ray is more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests put US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin drift hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also ent@@ ails his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , into the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant at all .
after he made the announcement at an election campaign session on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump res@@ igned in terms of the statement on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
by using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then dec@@ eler@@ ate as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone , as his surveys have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that ahead of Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ bro@@ ker , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by failing to get the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once sold at the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which was not Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices came out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which was sold in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it &apos;s also a rein@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafe , owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the club .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb broke out , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended ch@@ ai tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not make a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the cafe as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new client transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , scar@@ c@@ ely snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered to ro@@ ast h@@ ack@@ ed , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the ways with which the country was dealing with being no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole recovered as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food rem@@ n@@ ants , &quot; noted bricks , since chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out because a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome kitchen @-@ sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brick continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; hous@@ eholders &quot; and to live up to the challenge of meeting P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Pe@@ as@@ ants &quot; Kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke of the million @-@ million man from the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was truly alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if Ele@@ an@@ or &apos;s wife would not have asked him to give an example to his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dismissed as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were cleared , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a good trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone de@@ vol@@ ved something reluc@@ t@@ antly into the t@@ aming , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E fet@@ ched three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few h@@ ack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs on the Alz@@ heim@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it comes to it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal to a rich 2.@@ 6m / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle , characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock that life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has presum@@ ed that Greenland &apos;s hair is st@@ ony .
only the evidence failed .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they often appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les &apos; li@@ fest@@ y@@ les .
her slow motion was so to say that six animals were equipped with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
the loo@@ t nevertheless makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the iron @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which pe@@ at from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie who fet@@ ched fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers in size .
to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks found a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear tests carried large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of the third smallest animal which is 220 cm long , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons attempts , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all the larger Greenland sh@@ arks in their lens nucle@@ us had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known .
now the researchers of the length could al@@ locate a age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane systems live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ agus .
they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
the municipal council has dealt with issues related to building in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel gave the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently released residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on surve@@ ying , the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and former senior citizens equally .
as it was said , volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , the conf@@ is@@ cation of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to comply with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change its land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ timeless , the industrial area that has already been designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the Main has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt profits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether treas@@ ury shares may continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the so @-@ called EU passport so far is enough for them to be admitted in the UK .
big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight on the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk @-@ law ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , Luxembourg is also cutting off its infrastructure , just like Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate were at 50 percent higher than the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Merc@@ er , the city stands in seventh place , Luxembourg on number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , says the econom@@ ists .
in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt they were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. counterpart , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to the issu@@ ance of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were compl@@ ained of each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir admitted , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have reg@@ ained full control over the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are now comb@@ ing the town following the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters that have been buried within the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians being held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish announced the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters , which was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying on cleaning through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the democr@@ ats and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Hill donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton achieved USD 5,@@ 3 million in speech records ; former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ins from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ers in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for his refusal to submit a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Clinton &apos;s election campaign hero Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Democrats candidate for the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invites to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico announced that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that would still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , called Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released a tax return by 2007 .
the Clinton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these only pay USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with chil@@ i powder , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , has been working together with U.S. natural protection to intensi@@ fy its promotion by exercising volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harv@@ ests without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chil@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
a last possibility is a shi@@ pper shooting a gold @-@ fired fire@@ work in the air causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no Ki@@ osk@@ neu@@ bau at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the city council unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski@@ pper at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons , which was under construction .
&quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ m@@ ons - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media rebellion , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ elections , as Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee .
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was that there was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of them sub@@ stituted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have yiel@@ ded the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ dam@@ m , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to take Israel into the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting bra@@ zi@@ lian students
on Thursday , students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police stab@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the governor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters have seen gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ yed against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trading between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies in businesses grew strongly in the country , the ambassador agreed with .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial breakdown was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation granted approximately 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : inf@@ ested beverage market in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack was exer@@ ted on Thursday evening on the Be@@ verage market of Re@@ we XXL at the forest @-@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the am@@ bush of a gun bul@@ let , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the issuing of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not inform the police .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the attack , the perpet@@ rators must be run in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and must be fled from the gravel parking space in front of the car park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( around 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , are urgently to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers on their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet area of Lei@@ sure Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joy group was quartered during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the mat@@ ing zoo .
to the other to Mul@@ len , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days the group met at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and p@@ add@@ ling .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their homemade appe@@ tiz@@ ers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , b@@ ati@@ zed , beautiful gem@@ s made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman Mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings in the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ manu@@ frac@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
four stages have been ma@@ stered together .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all the altar boys in two years , the round of mini@@ stries of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
several pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 The min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , were on their way .
in the evening , priest Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and guided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster of Our Lady stands , and so the pilgri@@ m path was started from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a stop at the cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from specially created pilgri@@ m song booklet .

the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue in the evening at Bad@@ wei@@ her .
after dawn on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .

in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality were marked by a strong community experience .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ranked last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . J@@ enth@@ und made the legend hau@@ te when he rus@@ hed home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing win four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ di , Kenn@@ y - those four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic record in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds , New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ di fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation during which Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we set up an olymp@@ ic record and the World Champion defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph 2012 at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di showed that after a weak start , he deliberately fell on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the past three months .
with so many world titles we &apos;ve come so badly that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y it is possible to win Ho@@ y &apos;s win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is the next one to take part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they reached the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he argued with officers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow .
the GB team relies on his strong team of railways to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a flock of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
there were dra@@ mas in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bing , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to plant the plant .
a sub@@ vention laid down for 20 years is exp@@ iring in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the sm@@ el@@ ting consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melting pot , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Power Plant last year .
the al@@ coa sm@@ el@@ ting in Port@@ land loses money and risks losing .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting facility with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the business year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on AG@@ L recei@@ pts from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual closing in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power to melt the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force in November this year , even if it is still a statement of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts are warning about the bad economic conditions of the industry before the potential closure of Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set , that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ an ) , a craw@@ ling reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for the case Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) and the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act of nearly every anniversary episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beaten with the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking forward to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue the most sold out of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that is more reminiscent of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the manuscript 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover@@ t is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the journal still leak before the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or Brand Ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breaking model &quot; of her generation - falls below the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something exciting .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cul@@ min@@ ated once again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her handmade pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal real estate centres annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s most important resource centres are rejected by the municipal ech@@ el@@ ons each year , while the industry is focused on the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those with no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - in their quest for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Community Centr@@ es of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only become worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal real centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and crus@@ hing debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers as well as that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign : accused of Emplo@@ ye@@ es allegedly We@@ ap@@ on
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action , after being told that in February her campaign manager for North Carolina placed a gun on an employee while she was in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte &apos;s Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have been waiting for months that the matter would be internally regulated before real@@ ising that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ entes Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the bill of indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation arrives just two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ mann @-@ Ow@@ ners and Ar@@ ms @-@ Friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges were to appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and by Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
he has not responded to calls to his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : German elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys from the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could almost continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both German states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , while the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent .
according to the survey , according to the survey , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) would only come to 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 per cent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , by contrast , the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator was introduced to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the Western pocket format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e @-@ mails , including fax , was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , al@@ beit very slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then they found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold to Microsoft .
today , vendors now dominate the market , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s everyday for many people every day .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units are accounted for .
worldwide sales of equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has grown around the smartphone in the meantime .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ ant success began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we made a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will happen again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we will already provide 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ant on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in am@@ using growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; about ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors tries to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding for its advertisements in order to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of what part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the an@@ tim@@ ed open source community and the b@@ ans has been underway since the invention of display blo@@ ggers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use ad blo@@ cker ads , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has put it aside from desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a big share of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preference pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as ad preferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
woman in suspected suicide on a Swiss motorway
the victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning had a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ riding from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident , to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes distributed Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers cannot be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman of the negli@@ gent killing was acqu@@ itted after having passed over and killed a man running on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to a distress call -- drove to a justified fashion and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA air model Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have had similar conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still rot@@ ated slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus , similar to evolution that previously was suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen@@ ics escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect came back -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as a trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a slight co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
as an alternative , General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years , I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations der Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations has to be perfectly coordinated with the organization .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and reached the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups - two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume negotiations , start on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties for a new round of talks are sitting at the table said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ launch the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full day meetings over the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contrac@@ tions in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &apos; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place ever since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars rotate in star @-@ pil@@ es to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ations of the planets are associated with the formation of the planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ lets , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large quantities of star win@@ ches .
because these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler senses the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rotating slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stell@@ ations of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot ahead of us which we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to say hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star comes off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez has paid back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he created a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to have had forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until late 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , sweet@@ ly at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and portra@@ yed the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy and appreciation from the y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ rival Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ steep@@ le @-@ runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically pursued athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d had been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed the exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have been invited to participate more than 50 m of free style .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International S@@ CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news spread about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the female ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association banned the entire Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , and the country &apos;s lead nation in Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the previous violations in China also had caused violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t res@@ or@@ ted to the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I want to hand over to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t at the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also revol@@ ved around the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had been positively tested on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in the Chinese champion@@ ships , but had to lose only a three @-@ month lock .
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing @-@ malware are target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware Defence Speci@@ alists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past 12 months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victim of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the money required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators special@@ ise in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators detected black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was very fast in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
however , where private users have the personal photo database at stake , firms deal with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware beats .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only sponsor the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for example files .
and if private people are saved after payment of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate rigid and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , says safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa in a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that three or four persons are involved .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the previous malware kits have ar@@ isen , while the malware themselves , counsel@@ ing and additional tools have been purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful harv@@ ests , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators are then blocking an entire production line in a factory in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda will pack everything into the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant working effect , only the top of the cockpit is a little off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high height and 10@@ 26 l at inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V extremely powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a bit more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking wizard ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent motion control respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .

airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible for dangers which are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their trip , sick leave only gets money back when the cause of the illness is free of doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests exhibit the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door wed@@ ge .
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective sewage treatment plant which allegedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained to the promot@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organizers only heard about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion - belongs to the general life @-@ risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence perpet@@ rated by the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , it hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals until the 2017 Par@@ liam@@ entary elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the arms law will be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult .
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should remain intact in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister keeps a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly expressed himself against Action@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual citizenship .
it is a general prohibition of full @-@ wear@@ iness that it is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t ban all that is borrow@@ ed and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of attempting to simulate action and action with new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ o@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ rü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence permit people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it appears regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the environmental road every night in traffic jams when they cross the highway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Strasse and the De@@ acon Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is distributed as early as possible , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the suburbs of Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder makes drivers nervous especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return traffic goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ ese route and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the descent Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only guided by a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load @-@ bearing capacity to record the heavy @-@ duty traffic in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic jam will last cannot be said by the responsible state company .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining service period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal honey@@ moon , the state company has deliberately chosen the traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s initiative 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration background and a refugee background , provides the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most you@@ ths of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , is made up of languages , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvements
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night a das@@ h through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , you wal@@ low etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is long before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
at least one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how can sleep problems arise ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Batt@@ les and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
many people find their way to sleep as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be stuck , but also medicines .
sleep disorder is often an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors damp@@ en one another .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be bad , w@@ akes up every two or three hours , and possibly starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises wei@@ ghting .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , slept , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out about their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks .
lowered sleep medi@@ ators hardly exist in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , when sleeping problems , one should contact the family doctor first , advises wei@@ ghting .
this can be clari@@ fied by studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , medical professionals advise , for example , snor@@ ing with respiratory compens@@ ators , in case of abnormal fatigue , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze declared .
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; he says .
after cl@@ um@@ ming , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ frame , a chest strap and an anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping person on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can get a better sleep .
fire counts on : regular sleep and rise times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself via Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now placed himself in front of his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate , who protected him in his critic@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming is poor , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be registered for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream shop .
airport : bags arrested by baggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civil investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of the airport Dus@@ sel@@ dorf recognised a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past th@@ ef@@ ts .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July of this year and have been professionally , work@@ able and especially professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ min@@ ary Com@@ miss@@ ariat of Justice 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who have entered Germany specifically to commit crimes .
in total , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few tree @-@ trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like this , but the police count them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes some play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is supposed to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new flats is to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has been repeatedly calling for a hard action by the police against the project , which describes the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets , with 300 police officers on the ground floor , police pat@@ rolled 30 to 40 officials and three police officers on the ground for three weeks , blocking parts of the street and refra@@ ining from entering the house with the number 94 .
at the same time , construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the ev@@ ac@@ uation was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who mostly desired police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ens left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbors open , apparently does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today also has a low average income and high poverty rate compared to the rest of the city .
house @-@ occup@@ ations and the living projects born from it have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all of the Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : residents of East Germany and former home occup@@ ants share their neighborhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at raised windows or newly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing autonomy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the crime is to make break@@ downs , which tend to meet the newly renovated and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars have no longer existed in the Riga city for a long time .
for the architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved into the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not so well gro@@ uted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if you never listen to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the drawn @-@ out genes that are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a pub district , can &apos;t complain about noise .
all persons , presented only with first names , have asked not to be named with their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee advisor
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee deleg@@ ate for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ breaking wo@@ ol@@ ly sau , which mainly has a problem .
so some - less ridi@@ culous than on the large number of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
an administrative assistant with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , was sought after .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent substitute for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection supply .
they must place the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cils of coun@@ cils to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his home .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not working to rely on private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , training centers , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be jo@@ in@@ ted or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
the day requires a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so management and volunteers are also jumping here .
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and can brid@@ le the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever ever developed the feeling that he couldn &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : did the two after the most recent events fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these events are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics atro@@ phy .
actually it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would un@@ wind the situation .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing ones ration@@ ally .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ers looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 pm .
the residents surprised the two and hit the aw@@ k@@ ward in the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 feet tall , probably mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies wore .
they fled towards the city centre .
to this end , the police introduced several strip occup@@ ations as well as a police helicopter .
the search went without success .
the un@@ familiar ones , in fact , fell close to the apartment or when they fled .
