<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: golden sports pyramid for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they hunted at home in a fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen into the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British queen has already adjourned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prizewinner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is awarded not only for athletic achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting young talents.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive regulations massive, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which must be invested, trump and Clinton speak almost eloquently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be internal party discussions at Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump aims to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziative trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What drump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, there is a ump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him, so that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fledged women has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He curiously looks into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother gazes at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs initiated the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - neither as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape," "" "Bahr stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope-makers," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "in women, other reasons prevail:" "" "many are stealing away secretly, because they see no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their native country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable murder, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, that tugboats require a sexual act for a bottle of water," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you think that the end will be irre as soon as they arrive in Germany, Bahr tells us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and badly abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich appreciate that they are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children certainly did not volunteer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced, because shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their competence, some answered with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia there is not such a thing in accommodation of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are in some community shelters or their own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "also calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "in a study published for the committee, it says:" "" "it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "if privacy is lacking or will men and women stay together, it can come to - perpetual - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women feel this need for protection can be read off by the urge to go to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "since we've been around, we have a long waiting list," "" "Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, veterinarians and medical students voted on the refusal of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official negotiations on all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating work-fighting measures that began at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that veterinarians went on strike this year six times, the first general failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA assistance physicians, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54.000 assistants and medical students, stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gilded auditorium of St. Petersburg's palace, I can't deny that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked delicately and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable chilled out of Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launching of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time had been kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the canine will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first of all needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d'etat almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal assault on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television approved cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this includes the ongoing resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who picks up to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an "alliance of outsiders," as an analyst once described me: two countries that are violating and badly treated by the West, and now composing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed President Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest trust group for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who since 2012 was Deputy Assistant, was appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the leader of the protocol and staff of the governing body.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV channel that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov for a long time was one of the closest confideners Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president to redirect Russian environmental policy - stumbled upon great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, "Ivanov said:" it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entrust a placid post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office as a third term would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete kiss to the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor, said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances that the team are working on were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: in the future, investors are expected to be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Brunswick will lose almost 1300 favourable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "room for action" "" "at the next council meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban surfaces must in future testify to 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big point of contention in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but build as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and has to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher requirements for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding this, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is underway.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1300 beneficial apartments, whose promotion will be expelled in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, 500 dwellings will be available.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this from happening, the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the town.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, deadlines are running at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is further increased dramatically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called "mixing".</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "said Group leader Holger Herlitschke:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">In fact, I concentrated on more buildings for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside for playing, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, was sued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players move outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographs" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the train and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person withdraws every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch tracking 35.000 users, announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who exercise 30 minutes every day, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day," met deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are grumpy perishers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track down our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight event of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>

<seg id="21">Although it insisted that during their long way to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which include her typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will last for a long time as Balaam wants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was slightly led by two turns, the picture blurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedes and Bodenturns - in which Bales holds the title of the World Championship - they were lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and sat on top with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears poured into fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to myself under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three female Turnerists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kobe, the Catholics, rounds off everybody.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic champion and America jubelted.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual Americans, who won gold in an individual multi-battle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see sneakers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are a costly sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started their gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches out of innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnasium training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth of high quality gymnastics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls to interest in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanking you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "if you are approaching from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and" "" "go out of the cast line," "" "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat it with the knees into the bar and twist while the attacker cribs against pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip, before they move backwards and turn the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabels his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler subdued his immune system and theflex of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, came out of Suffolk on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush with a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking out each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of deactivating the flush button of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily there was nothing left to leak, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to dishwashers from toilets, the task set his immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to live up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test specimen showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its luminometric time amounted to over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories" "" "Niko Vuorenmaa" "" "says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming sessions that ended up saying" "" "Call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally use products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their homes after delocation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trepiccock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were covered with gaping holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage sprinkled on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, since delonization is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to remove rubbish mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon earned a fine after she pleaded guilty to owning a class B drug in commercial foresight.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported by the leadership of Kenya by doping control engineers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far it is not stupid: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't have to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate parts at the end, only to work laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final days of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern now has to pass a campaign scarcely close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how much territory breaks down AfD and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign of election, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now probably to cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if you are in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Angela Merkel has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to a large-scale documentary; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel once again from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that in the country you are clearing the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any presence in the vast expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert on his comrades is also self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village elders, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats recently complained with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the day of the land.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their holiday need and make their election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online campaign" "", "is the name of the presidents Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green ballots are going to search for local voters under the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff off the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "vowed will also be the receipt of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of Behelessentrances." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been abolished and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The passing traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable complaints," "" "said Florian King, responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation project." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">As speed limits were not met, the congregation encouraged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself able to speak about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been brewed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was at 77 km / h in the tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to growth in turnover lets anyone you ask is able to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for whom the refurbishment hardly has consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "maximum slight decline" "", "but also admits that" "" "the travelling documentary is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the sales losses are" "" "far above 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the roadmap has" "" "thrown back" "" "its operation" "" "two years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts, where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars ignore less frequently due to complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his family-clientele returns to the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="24">Many things also have an unexpected effect and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to imagine that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to skip it under the pseudonym of non-avenue men of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of records is not due to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a plate are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers hold their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stuffing wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something better: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent salesmen were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of appendage of the plate revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phenergan to realize that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older clients picked up the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gramophone cases, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is something for me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally employ yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floated from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicranky.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has almost a whole floor dedicated to the records, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest Synthesizer- and sextant Pop instead of experimental jazz tunes from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but the psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been in business for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is..." "" "she drives off with a dearest sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to mutate the pants-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not by strolling through platter shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of no suspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais declared that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hair services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "" "absolutely comprehensible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids "Café, which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in different federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which are to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a lasting mobile design can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive ban on time, lanes and vehicle classes can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the state-of-the-art state, the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain in the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday evening, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the gloomy stadium here.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one brite will hang a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfully and allowed the attacks to bounce off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB rarely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrific Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua turned a touch down in the right corner and stood 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the whistle and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou stressed further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GGB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB caused major changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half until Joshua passed through Fiji after a brilliant mid-play.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left-hand corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sealed-Sullians, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked annihilly hit in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton pierced the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinthine gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard hassle that enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two men sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they followed the second Olympiad in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of the British sport who laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.95 unshot bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a contribution to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so soon I had to get better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wreaking morning with it a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who spent 31 years in the Association of Employees, including 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The potable water utility of the Veitenstein Group, located in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approx. 150000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member churches are the municipalities of Kirchloud, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the "Zweckverband" in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work over office and organizational activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the elevated tank (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has never been any downtime and again and again there have been new additions, because water means living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-expedient as if it were his own company.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the branch of green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Freitagung).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">According to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told WAZ, there is now a basic statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent takes place.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of producers made massive steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation was somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, suspended import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, economic prospects have risen in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated more.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the produced crowd went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir. in the teacher's degree course she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular coexistence, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures often dissolve, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing this, senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of the powder as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at an old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or hearing songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who have denied themselves denounce long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of singing, a special power is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are doing so, not just concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, Hackler recommends.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing praises the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="10">In the morning a bomb explosion was reported from Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation in the vicinity of the seaside resort of Patong, which was popular with vacationers, was injured by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani at the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive set had gone into the air in front of the territorial police in a flower bed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several wounded in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - it is probable, however, about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police assisted their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not turn against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace built over the years of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the explosive bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary travel will be discouraged in these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military a great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the insurrectionary rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stroke by a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the Rio de Janeiro summer games.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place in 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-level calculation, the waste water price in Azo will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Kulmbach district office established that undercover for these sewage treatment plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as business and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to resort deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee rises between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, surplus and undercover from the previous calendar period are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities deal with relatively small facilities with a very low sewer system, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recumbent calculations period in all three plants not least due to their age refurbishment and repair expenditures, a considerable amount was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azores is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt also pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the waste water plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be recovered from the ground and at the pond settlement Lopp, after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses were the continued assistance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still far below the current level during the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water case in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance "were fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past 20 years, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment expenses, has been spared the process.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned facilities will remain precarious in the long run according to Steinhäuser, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage treatment association could not be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit of facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Snapchat" "" "Anime" "" "effect as Asian cartoon criticises" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">The Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are lifelike, standalone tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshootting filters have gone critically in the past where they were accused of the app to propagate Blackface enhanced or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have turned the feature off.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism recalled the filtering of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos have been widely spread that the filter was "hurtful and inconvenient."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very resilient Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreciating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the settings practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR officer who focused on subordinated population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said she would let her Snapchat account be closed and she added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K. '.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Commitment Committee, secret service committees and the military budget committee, reports about great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-related information, typically obtained from high-ranking Centcom commanders, periodically reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The misleading mistakes in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed continous problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than it meets the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom citizen publicly announced that a military reconquest of Moslems could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command centers shifted intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to life after it was shut down that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense's general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Demokrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the moral of analysts and" "" "gave overly little space for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who were ingested by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critique of the secret information about the Islamic State commemorates feuds of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres, commander Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having fired three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed the strong Dutch woman a little longer to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey club in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door-row in the first half of the game with a back-hand envelope.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and lucked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and inevitable, a furious relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the wristband to float to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow there are the sports which are not universally recognised: gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely noticed that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadian women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has some outsiders, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear fitting for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dodging enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending swelling - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, piercing and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, you will be judged according to the design, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further increased goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarecord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even touch a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming for 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by obtaining and objectifying male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters have been killed during the clashes with policemen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia currently going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a fight for this jagged, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been defeated more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness explode after years of getting worse under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians insisted that they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly prospered in politics and economy, as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them innocuous.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which, according to analysts, had apparently been falsified by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raid many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an ampersian city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred for the Tigray is more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr. Abdi," "" "is a very thin drift hike." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans's presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he made the announcement at an election campaign session on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resigned in terms of the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">By using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he felt strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I thought sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then decelerate as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clear "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corroborated tone, as his surveys have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that ahead of Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back-broker, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to get the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it accelerates the five-metre-long animal to a rich 2.6m / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterized by loneliness, seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock that life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist has presumed that Greenland's hair is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they often appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles' lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow motion was so to say that six animals were equipped with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">The loot nevertheless makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the iron-sea and look for cadavers, which peat from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grönlandhaie who fetched fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks found a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the third smallest animal which is 220 cm long, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all the larger Greenland sharks in their lens nucleus had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimetres was even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could allocate a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland's sharks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane systems live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland-wal, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director smashed Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" summons - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media rebellion, after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-elections, as Arab guests had "requested" according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel on the list of the hotels.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searching for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there shocked him, "as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel employee said that the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind this was that there was even more anger in the director.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "the Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a" "" "big disgrace" "", "reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is really very embarrassing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">No explanation is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of them substituted the Kempinski Hotel that it would have yielded the alleged afforestation of Arab guests. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "don't be ashamed," "" "said it in another article, in which it was noted that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest in Russian companies in businesses grew strongly in the country, the ambassador agreed with.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports rose by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>

<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign representation granted approximately 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2">A robbery attack was exerted on Thursday evening on the Beverage market of Rewe XXL at the forest-bröler Gerberstraße.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Emanufractal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages have been mastered together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romance journey of all the altar boys in two years, the round of ministries of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 The minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, priest Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed pilgrimages and guided the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady stands, and so the pilgrim path was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a stop at the crossroads, chapels or churches to sing together a song from specially created pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays there were pastors of the local parishes available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ordered a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first some 500 meters of altitude had to be lowered and then again heard again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue in the evening at Badweiher.</seg>
<seg id="16">After dawn on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster the Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert, who arrived at the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality were marked by a strong community experience.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner ranked last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. Jenthund made the legend haute when he rushed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindi, Kenny - those four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner placed an Olympic record in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds, New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindi fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation during which Hindu went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an olympic record and the World Champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph 2012 at the site Kenny and Hoys, Hindi showed that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">With so many world titles we've come so badly that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny it is possible to win Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is the next one to take part in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this just for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he argued with officers before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team of railways to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were dramas in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sexism and bulbbing, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle rom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to plant the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subvention laid down for 20 years is expiring in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the smelting consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry melting pot, which led to a closure of the Anglesea Power Plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The alcoa smelting in Portland loses money and risks losing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting facility with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting" "", "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the business year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on AGL receipts from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual closing in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts is the" "" "Alcoas" "" "ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power to melt the melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force in November this year, even if it is still a statement of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warning about the bad economic conditions of the industry before the potential closure of Portland smelting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 MW and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act of nearly every anniversary episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her beaten with the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking forward to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue the most sold out of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that is more reminiscent of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the manuscript 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his covert is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the journal still leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior Brand Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breaking model" of her generation - falls below the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners do not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something exciting.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistress of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings culminated once again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying on the Missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only become worse without repealing the decision of the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's municipal real centres are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who have been dismissed by separations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent, meaning that thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), there are considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys from the INSA opinion research institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could almost continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both German states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), while the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite light losses, the Greens hesitated to return to Schwerin Landtag despite a slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, according to the survey, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) would only come to 23 per cent (2011: 28.3 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is thus still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">With 14 per cent, the AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Representatives for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA air model Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have had similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still rotated slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution that previously was suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogenics escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect came back -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars rotate in star-piles to different rates, and in what context the rotations of the planets are associated with the formation of the planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other starlets, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rates, these poignant stars repel large quantities of star winches.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-steeple-runner Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically pursued athletics competitions these messages come to the end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid had been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed the exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have been invited to participate more than 50 m of free style.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands of Chen full co-operation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International SCAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news spread about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said," "" "an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "said the female athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the banned substance is the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately reported criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon as his brother Tomasz three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association banned the entire Russian crew except for systematic doping, and the country's lead nation in Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming-sport, the previous violations in China also had caused violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt resorted to the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m of free style, I want to hand over to me," "" "said Lacourt at the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun also revolved around the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," "" "said this." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014 Sun had been positively tested on the stimulant Trimetazidin in the Chinese championships, but had to lose only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing-malware are targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Defence Specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past 12 months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victim of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the money required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "says Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators detected blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was very fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users have the personal photo database at stake, firms deal with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware beats.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only sponsor the problem," "" "explained Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are saved after payment of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate rigid and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware circa in a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that three or four persons are involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits have arisen, while the malware themselves, counseling and additional tools have been purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">One logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful harvests, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escalations," "" "says Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then blocking an entire production line in a factory in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant working effect, only the top of the cockpit is a little off.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V extremely powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a bit more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>

<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent motion control responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">It appears regularly on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the legal remedy is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the environmental road every night in traffic jams when they cross the highway of Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Strasse and the Deacon Weser Straße at 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is distributed as early as possible, thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the suburbs of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road constriction on the feeder makes drivers nervous especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return traffic goes up to the bridge over the Alberese route and sometimes beyond.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you wallow eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is long before the wake-up ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems arise?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes may be underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Battles and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, that is, a disturbance and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people find their way to sleep as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, mental or behavioural factors can be stuck, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder is often an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in case of depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors dampen one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, it can be bad, wakes up every two or three hours, and possibly starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises weighting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, slept, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out about their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lowered sleep mediators hardly exist in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems, one should contact the family doctor first, advises weighting.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, medical professionals advise, for example, snoring with respiratory compensators, in case of abnormal fatigue, in sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze declared.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clumming, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-frame, a chest strap and an antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping person on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can get a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fire counts on: regular sleep and rise times, do not sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, civil investigators of the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several pocket and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 p.m., civil servants in the area of the airport Dusseldorf recognised a gang that was known to the policemen from past thefts.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year and have been professionally, workable and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Criminary Commissariat of Justice 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who have entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few tree-trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes some playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is supposed to be demolished soon, is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new flats is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has been repeatedly calling for a hard action by the police against the project, which describes the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets, with 300 police officers on the ground floor, police patrolled 30 to 40 officials and three police officers on the ground for three weeks, blocking parts of the street and refraining from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who mostly desired police protection from vandaliens left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors open, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty rate compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">House-occupations and the living projects born from it have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: residents of East Germany and former home occupants share their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at raised windows or newly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words" "" "left-wing autonomy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the crime is to make breakdowns, which tend to meet the newly renovated and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is weightlifting: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars have no longer existed in the Riga city for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not so well grouted," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never listen to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the drawn-out genes that are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a pub district, can't complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee advisor</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee delegate for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-breaking woolly sau, which mainly has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less ridiculous than on the large number of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative assistant with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, was sought after.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent substitute for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been acknowledged." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection supply.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must place the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councils of councils to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not working to rely on private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internships, training centers, school grounds, one-euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be jointed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "Regine reports." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day requires a firm structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So management and volunteers are also jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and can bridle the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever ever developed the feeling that he couldn't help anyone in Urbach, could not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the most recent events fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine Customer says clearly," "" "what some may call naïve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins were completely repudiated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics atrophy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would unwind the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher is already busy to integrate the existing ones rationally.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
