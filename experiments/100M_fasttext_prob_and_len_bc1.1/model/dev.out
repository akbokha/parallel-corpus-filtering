Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
Obama &apos;s deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partly classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor ple@@ aded to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bling on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the university , forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where he died , said that he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have an absence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he re @-@ entered into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why He went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doctorate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met by mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night on September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harp playing in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked each other .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt were also part of the Mah@@ n@@ guard , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; University sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police now says that Lamb had called the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that Lamb in his distress called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but toy and baby products dealers say that it will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start in this month with interviews and the number of employees rises from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox lear@@ ns about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and a length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN Bureau calls again on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the Council of Shar@@ eholders in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show in Syria the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks when poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start dropping their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P voters would be happy with jump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 would say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he doesn &apos;t have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they raise their hats , republi@@ can voters hold dr@@ um@@ ps for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four out of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters consider Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said they made up their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump say that they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a hub in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of dr@@ ump cards will keep His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation effort .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration stays in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans are saying in the new Mon@@ days @-@ pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ ders than anyone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa republi@@ cs are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ art Trail - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street one square meter of a homeless house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student boy in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double gate protection in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e created a dream start in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at FC Bayern in Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive victory in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
with his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership Müller , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed a shot of the World Champion to be considered as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich audience kept the word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shine .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was proud to stum@@ ble here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but in their offensive efforts often too resour@@ ceful to works .
the attacks were introduced too often by reloc@@ ation to left @-@ side Douglas Costa , who rarely came through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field struck in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
at first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker , Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the pol@@ o &apos;s header from the line ( 26 ) .
then by a direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto took his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern had their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to make needle stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a decree .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Guinea , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain guard with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the qualifying session , said S &amp; D member Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , that &apos;s really bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , Müller made another bet on it .
before the game , it was in the stadium of craw@@ ling .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans had apparently provoked the followers of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures in their spect@@ ator blo@@ c , the security forces attacked and went with po@@ thol@@ es against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only damages the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk sin@@ ks rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking smokers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely was increased by 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again fell to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , first author Thomas Dietrich from Birmingham University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , study leader H@@ einer Boeing in DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels , and according to our findings , it also results in good dental health up to high age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the start of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
all construction projects in the Cologne city district have always been added to the museum as a department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
along with rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is picked up at the train station in the direction of the fi@@ ddle ir@@ is , the Federal Police asks the people to help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock , the woman crosses the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its functioning , corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , responsible for the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ection to the sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it plans to work on an international investment court according to its own data .
there could be , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which were mainly obtained by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ist justice to which companies can le@@ verage compensation for tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act submitted the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they are not to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has drawn up in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic impact of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
to date , however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;

delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the timi@@ dly acting fol@@ ks@@ eller the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture .
he talks about different places he repeatedly records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ti@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell .
where they were born and how it looks , in his home .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always be opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that Mich@@ igan would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states states should be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
the guitar and the ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks an annual list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components .
this sixth studio album is still orchest@@ rated yet , but is carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens tou@@ red Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the band plays excell@@ ently through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens only thanks to an en@@ core , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire with tension has been anticipated ever since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; D Group and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ b@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a restriction overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; fighting &quot; and stri@@ pping with bar@@ bs , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Council , will be represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the sub@@ contractor &apos;s spokesperson , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds R@@ ise By Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased jump @-@ like according to data showing a rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est app@@ rais@@ al since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer by the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , bringing brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures reflect all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - are reporting back growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares increased 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimation for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to a potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
these are both - in the case of the Pot@@ ato D@@ öner , which the Ol@@ denburg hed@@ ger@@ ie owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ el instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him to a poster during a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen on TV .
since then , a barbecue sauce is spinning in his shop , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has since allowed the Leban@@ ese to enter the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also appeals to its customers .
Met@@ cash starts wei@@ ght@@ rope campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Con@@ soli@@ dation Camp@@ a@@ ign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners selling cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual Investor Strategy Day .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ als &apos;s I@@ GA shop shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will catch some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million in turnover per year and met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that revenue in the food and food business will rise by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear .
met@@ cash refused to publicly react to the Mr Dou@@ glass comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which has been supplied by around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operations at equivalent pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores with fast @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label food .
met@@ cas@@ h@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and shop renovation programs will rise to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will again return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gy@@ s and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat the Assy@@ rian and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp ne@@ sted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly &apos;s Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am more concerned about is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open due to a sei@@ z@@ ure , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained hard , he &apos;s well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gios on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm part in the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick made the climb very quickly what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency situation and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted by Serbian officials .
the people who fled from violence hid for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration grew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels not to agree on a common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the flooded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would have reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit from the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a verbal action from Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation scheduled on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison camps were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the entry point in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac &apos;s spokes@@ man in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the off@@ ence of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian civil servants closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos embra@@ ced the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and put a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 failed to enter but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to have a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he is candidates for the Pres@@ idency , will receive 15 percent support from the prim@@ aries of democratic voters .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choices than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ ander generated some gains .
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
her support with the men is clearly decreased , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton still has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ ander has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more strongly mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the ability to vote are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance shell , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he shouldn &apos;t do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den is their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike last month , no single demo@@ cra@@ t candidate or potential candidate for these sel@@ ections is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics among voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as being honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best scored with the three candidates from hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect overall opinions .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed of it .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the entitled voters nationwide consider also tr@@ ump cards as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump have good marks in leadership .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democ@@ rat voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose dramatically their support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demographic groups and passes trou@@ gh under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the most , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - he lands with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed dr@@ um@@ ps clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing holi@@ day@@ makers to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea any more : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
swimming temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a mon@@ astic ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call for the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ zu@@ f Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly bl@@ amed with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year at the ch@@ ic@@ ane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of deport@@ ation attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the rush is falling into wa@@ vering , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little instructions on how to proceed .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that property fees rise 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest , fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return will start to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent of the Atlanta F@@ ed figures for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all year round , market participants have prepared themselves for an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shade after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticipated a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with stocks when they change their strategic direction .
in case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the development cycle , the star@@ ches immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields closer together between longer and shorter bonds and result in fl@@ atten@@ ing the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins extended , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens up its strategy .
in the large and complete , companies operating the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from it when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of the pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher returns , even when experts of different opinions are , how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , maintains a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just a different name for The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham .
BBC general director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it must be worked harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports , to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins seized The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it star@@ es a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed down issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales department .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 output a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
for some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the vast Sau@@ dis Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ners filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to declare their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession procession passed to the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane broke through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king passed a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 suffer@@ ers who were killed when a crane fell by the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane went down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the crane stop when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company is prohibited abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner court of the Great Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other injured receive half of this amount .

it is claimed that Br@@ its laid down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY store chain said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has since out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professionals and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men prevail .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households performing more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK leader in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company occup@@ ying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group ap@@ ologi@@ zed for closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner @-@ up master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused decided that in 2006 to 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from club accounts to which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
he zi@@ ps the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial passing .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
to the dis@@ miss@@ al of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was incurred by the association .
the sports officials had only comp@@ uted allowance and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted around 600@@ ,000 sm@@ s in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , a bread@@ winner of the financial department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance under@@ tak@@ ings as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the detention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was deposited on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings also seemed to have appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and led@@ gers kept the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial gam@@ bl@@ ity , it was important that it was only the freedom of debt , so the answer was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official investigation began in 2011 due to official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants explained .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent failed to answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
this bank transfer has been formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
why claim compensation ? , Ju@@ dge and Public Prosecutor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this wording , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged 1,000 euros per month for the association , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was considered correctly , they declared .
kilomet@@ re money also referred to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the fixes have to be made in cash , in addition , he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more 30.000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been running for three years , the company will reduce further jobs during the spl@@ itting up of the company .
the stops at the US computer terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client segment .
as a result , costs amounting to $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall off in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share issued 2.3 percent on the stock exchange rate .
the company grown with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto is now spl@@ itting up : so the computer and printer store will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the future @-@ proof areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer according to Lenovo was last updated .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split @-@ up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded only late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans altogether envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly result in rejection : 54 per cent said against it , 35 percent showed themselves appro@@ ving .
61 percent of other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad would reject 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September linked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can attend the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto Union expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : interruption of Viol@@ ence at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police was deployed against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ lights .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind this , a police line was formed and a water laun@@ cher was station@@ ed behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped using pep@@ per@@ mint .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn some time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees split into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation rate .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death ar@@ cher at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology letter
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and someone has killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call center that police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give it .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb passed 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ sh had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his CV on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely requires its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost group conversion to the workplace .
however , with the pilot &apos;s union there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and appreci@@ ating Eu@@ row@@ ings &apos;s cheap daughter .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the pilots &apos; association Cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the judi@@ ci@@ ally stopped strike .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come as quickly as possible with sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the drivers , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer defender to weeping and shut him out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will take and he will not play during the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers from the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , Britain &apos;s Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead gives a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree . &quot;
as if that were not yet dou@@ bt@@ ful enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially reading , like the abstract of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , thri@@ ving on@@ ce @-@ ler despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , slu@@ gg@@ ish being , &quot; speaking in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees but no further comments were made .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting line , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at the test plane , is an option for the attack .
this is related news : Adam Ly@@ th turns out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer receives in order to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I put on high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques beside cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred re@@ treats and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup j@@ acks that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ e@@ ah , the B@@ ats@@ man of Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in harmony with what has been said before .
Gary &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light @-@ hear@@ ted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Stock Exchange ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain ground if the economy enters a sl@@ um until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s unc@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is going deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought violent because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes , which they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not go alone with France , &quot; Berlin says - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as it has been done for the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term rent@@ ers like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .

that &apos;s why some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of Tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ länder , who own most of our large newspapers .
in fact Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you get better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .

it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional bl@@ under @-@ dy@@ e tendencies and the wild fav@@ ors of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ b@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ lo@@ y@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; in all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on the Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ ne@@ n &apos;s fundamental equi@@ val@@ ence to EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ly economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all sense , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health British report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims from a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ent@@ Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco administration was attended by P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are used as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second , lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clearly suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ y , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ y and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to place public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ poll@@ uted time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ door communications committee in the scope of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that do not make or commission others .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ary is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his commentary on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows is what former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like East@@ ern@@ y was supposed to sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify four billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , we all think that one gets a great value here for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , clarify and conver@@ se . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters to make alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depth of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , chal@@ ced@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ imped@@ ed and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists join the work with activists in protest movements and notice that they must move outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fair - through a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a stri@@ de of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the Ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry into student residen@@ ces reaches from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ out : people tell where you came from , if and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let Man be .
people often transform into beverages , film @-@ night venues and local meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear .
based on this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
apro@@ pos sei@@ zing : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship joining through baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the Back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I put you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they can use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a washing up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , people stop from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if they had anything to make , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded to it with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbors were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she pl@@ agu@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your spouse would enter the same student residence random@@ ly ?
on the other hand , it would not be very deep embarrass@@ ing when you are holding a room@@ mate for your future spouse , joining them , separating themselves , and seeing them every day , and perhaps experience how they move all together friends to each other ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co@@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give some reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good place is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never deposit any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
seal your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .

thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ bert : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain here for a great deal here .
given the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space over the next decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ bert : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without grounds .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : legally , I have correctly dra@@ fted my project .
the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking ordin@@ ance are particularly complicated .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for it .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only rede@@ em@@ ing mother or the cour@@ ier .
I show you how to build cheap and good today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update is failing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush comes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might turn off at half way and this could lead to a break@@ age of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a dedicated chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which was accepted by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; center have joined forces under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations , you can also participate in courses .
the Sozial@@ stiftung places it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors receive information on issues such as care insurance or health care services .
for years we have been using our out@@ patient care service to ensure that depend@@ ant relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of insur@@ ances are not seldom used , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders will see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to reconciliation in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing get together . &quot;
this makes the Sozial@@ stiftung a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus gives an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was said in the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men examine in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was located at the altitude of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al i@@ vory break and ble@@ w strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the temple , he first left off his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to the apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
with the help of a beat pitch , one checked on the face and the upper thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue description of the perpet@@ r@@ ator is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stagn@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : on October 1st Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice Fel@@ stagn@@ ausen .
while Ur@@ sel spent some time in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase Müller opened the practice again on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first sight when the fel@@ lows came to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ in who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital , who also wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just ph@@ oned it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and is involved in the DRC @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen operates as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and debit EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be granted to the mill@@ ers as part of a funding program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ linger mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ stagn@@ ation every quarter , in the North German average practice it is approximately 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
if no successor found himself , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way , still look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialist employees and the cleaning power of the field staff .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little melanch@@ oly after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I &apos;ve always been pressed against gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
like the Minister of Ministers , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees would have tried in the night hours of Tuesday to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in action .
in the coming days , his country has some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Macedonia @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was the people who suggested itiner@@ aries : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was said .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived . in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat far@@ ther west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently received a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the reports of the media reports , they spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two transgres@@ sions of Amor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to so@@ o@@ the Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ denti@@ ary appearance in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high levels of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ e@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals accused of having provided insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ - and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , in@@ sider trading on the financial markets was to be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over $ 100 million was launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further accused persons in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to act both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people carry out their err@@ ands , partly fast steps , partly comfortably rot@@ ting .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car showroom at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ all life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
with this action the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was alert to her 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions like the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s spontaneously reach the chal@@ k and read the phrase about &quot; driving my life , &quot; &quot; continue with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for long , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ co Car@@ rier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action was good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people .
an assessment which An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended , financial prospects improved for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his boat transportation service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share posted about 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and € 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in earlier predic@@ tion .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower probability comes in spite of the price increases , which amounted to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ goods transports of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid yields if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday occupation were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which twelve from Z@@ acks Investment Research in@@ quired analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts at $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices , while the result was down due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ ag@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey seat , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the pres@@ i@@ ding pres@@ i@@ ding Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy shows that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm of Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rates , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a failure of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage declined by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation in order to calm the financial markets in order not to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
yet a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , with which the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
la@@ vis@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a higher interest rate , has made reference in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives turned back these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market quar@@ ry in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she fears an interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ osen said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should advance the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome to prepare is not without the engagement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home on the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to inform women in a shock@@ ing way how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction permit for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ese sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the panel had , among other things , adopted an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn led to the tilt of the roof , which was prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan allows no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to the roof @-@ tilt , whereby the amber Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or generally is rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not a recur@@ rent project for gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the coun@@ cils of coun@@ cils .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned , namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprise plans of the County Hospital of the county , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move with fishermen and the further existing center to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership as of 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer special@@ ises in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fis@@ her@@ man and his team are to lead both houses until next year , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ ap@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 if the currently running refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house which is owned by the Federal Office of Justice will be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there were several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term maintenance of Car@@ itas and a daily hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions today ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) is called for at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no need for an arro@@ gan@@ ce .

hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use as the police announced .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .
the police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who have been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police wed@@ ged on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was arrested also on Tuesday evening is considered to be active , who , according to the specification , was admitted and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was a criminal suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the police inter@@ ro@@ gated the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward to the port hop@@ per on Wednesday , while the investig@@ ators put him under attack .
the investigation of the near@@ er circum@@ stance is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need lodging : study warns of apartment gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Association for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers after the first three months of their stay .
many then join the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in housing policies over the past few years .
Germany is aiming for a public deficit , which will grow from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 living units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in room@@ mate share rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased for the first time over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
in this way , the land tax would be reno@@ unc@@ ed and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed dwell@@ ings will be suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation methods are necessary .
the funding program for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W ( Kf@@ W ) is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros were already available on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free travel : Croatia and Slovenia are set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the launch of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police launched the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
the refugees do not reach the border fence at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
but there are other dangers on the border : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers must now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after Hung@@ arians there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 people attacked .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
in the southern Hungary border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , there were a total of 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; tran@@ se@@ zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers started to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the racks in the bor@@ der@@ land has been reconstructed .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
about 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on sun@@ day we were busy with ti@@ dying when ten people were suddenly standing at the door of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
but because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we did not even sti@@ f@@ le the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring it to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers rose from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u . after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , it was still possible to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was placed on the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially translated the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ lo@@ id of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic states are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seeking people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands fully to do with refugee activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first acquisition centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already managed to get a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have any homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ istic year .
to fulfil the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the national tri@@ bun@@ es , he has already held talks .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it runs well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also has great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it may not be that neighbour@@ hoods must maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he was more successful in placing himself , Konrad uses his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , who is not telling the truth without further notice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any costs as they stated themselves .
their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four .
the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties concerned are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in the event of an emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the Mayor exercises cri@@ tique of the distribution of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer phone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the further departure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the issue of refugees .
for P@@ ühr@@ inger , now that Austria again adop@@ ts controls on its borders , it is a logical consequence of the procedure of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group has entered into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company invested 1.7 million euros in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta had wanted to breed a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ aden without further ado : after all , it has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop opposite the shop , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve wonder@@ ed if I should open a shop for a long time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater Linz Europe that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has brought her fashion @-@ interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag is in rap@@ ture can also not answer the woman with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag re@@ inv@@ okes every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excit@@ ers .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , mani@@ f@@ ests journalists , or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ ne @-@ hair@@ style is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they somehow find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their kan@@ ten@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous shoots , to which beside Tr@@ ump is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a loc@@ ale for gold graves in the USA .
foundation stone of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not pick up tr@@ ump because he was h@@ ew@@ n away without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so dev@@ out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t get the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which the pump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cin@@ emas , also in the USA interest is awak@@ ened .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden national park , the 1,@@ 800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in neighbouring countries the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise generated an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 viewers at the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the last few months , the issue of Sunrise was closed .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance ran@@ ged from 40,000 to 50,000 .
until now , sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking out !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , yiel@@ ded 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 people on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
average number of hot Se@@ at 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ a of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that the Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sarah &apos;s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well @-@ suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood would be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set to him without hes@@ itation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne selected the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench , when he lost a scra@@ m@@ ble , as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converts with his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a Pun@@ t Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue will over@@ lap the issue of asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective areas for refugees in Syria , as did them during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in big @-@ scale town should not fall under the table .
a long term on the agenda remains the order of the day : the education policy .
for the new school year , cultural minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , in which an extension of the secondary school from three to four years was tested .
but that &apos;s not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free drive at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed the trend @-@ free and nervous sales performance with profits over a long period of time .
only in the afternoon was a festive opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized M@@ DA@@ X gained 0.@@ 54 percent on 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the trading stations in London and Paris also earned solid profits .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted around 1 percent in the US .
many Bör@@ se@@ tians reck@@ on that markets will take place right up to the interest rate decision in the US and also to the big decline on the dates on this Friday .
the debate about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces even at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be lacking 30 billion euros of provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently re@@ treated somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

according to a retail@@ er , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend .
according to this , investors are currently giving little attention to the German chip maker .
investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were again sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the automobile manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police put rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Ru@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber com@@ bs , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work in a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake which killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000 m2 area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4,000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the Alte Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it is called the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
correspon@@ dingly , no contracts had been signed .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner Grand Street , already purchased a few months ago and the buildings on it were torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday houses at the Small sea near Em@@ den takes shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure mission
for months I had been negotiating , writing , deb@@ ating and drawing behind closed doors .
now the plans for a new holiday village on the small sea near Em@@ den lie on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Council of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ased went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fierce reactions among the sea bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ d owner and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole cargo charges to expect that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches a dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ thrown the European Nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war sh@@ attered by Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity procedures for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are ill @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I below those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical di@@ ab@@ etic treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was cured at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison to this , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and were more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in obes@@ e people who tried to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any benefit to the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so also in recent Roman &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel would be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück &apos;s readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main occupation author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could place a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mitt@@ edly is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is inadequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved this problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the road to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
toxic control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ infection of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age reporting toxic control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products more and more , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can intentionally drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles allegedly have mixed san@@ i@@ ti@@ sing with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol pois@@ oning can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic@@ ity centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in H@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding in the school , was taken to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah packed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl fell by the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases via alcohol pois@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ne@@ sted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare themselves for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic had to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now standing at the top of the table with five points , was followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the way - but we must go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .

Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later dropped - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desperate to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which brought them a margin of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ m in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in tro@@ phy games or le@@ agues that have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it grows overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I &apos;ll be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of rel@@ inqu@@ ishing my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to mention all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man persu@@ aded to go out of the C@@ anning River after the police pursu@@ its
the c@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he over@@ came the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called on Tuesday to a domestic peace of mind in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he was aiming for ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ pi test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held himself 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too highly dro@@ op@@ ing grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk raised head around and I want my owners to think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before that , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly remember their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and push me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to pon@@ der on it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Train@@ ers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have been established with the long lasting cob@@ alt research at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race days treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg .
it could have been the same last night .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be confronted with a 3 @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits back ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two premi@@ er league favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos coach Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed comment on the storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , as it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s coming up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ fight when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing weight , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
I also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the match Bron@@ cos vs Cow@@ boys .
the match of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are they p@@ auses and do not score points ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the storm team released this weekend , because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin the next Tuesday morning .
Serbian beer with $ 200,000 b@@ ail for drug delivery
a man who might face a life @-@ long penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and stopped in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , noti@@ fies the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : cab ri@@ ps apart
in the event of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the operator &apos;s cab of the accident trauma torn apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she fell asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately alar@@ ming her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web @-@ searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then said to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it had happened , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked them to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the act of indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before court for a hearing on March 24 of this year .
defense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg not to appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; should be found in its transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders even prior to the date of the judgment .
Schle@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up from the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
out of fear of discovery and arrest , many of the locks increased the number of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic guns to the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
on Wednesday again , there were clearly more refugees at Munich Main Station following federal police data .
some 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , currently warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the last few days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in particular in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with bends of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour , the DW@@ D is still to be counted .
on Friday you can look back on the sun for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the automobile manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , movement in the compact cars is especially noticeable , which is currently particularly well selling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17th to 27th September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan investor wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines perfectly fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the exterior , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time by Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued a law to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Ministry of Justice Te@@ gel who was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the victims may even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who is now on the loose foot after his lawyer &apos;s statements , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his official position due to the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
chamber Court therefore decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of adher@@ ence to the compensation were decisive for the in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of cash compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
that is why they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ man@@ a@@ geable .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks the pris@@ ons in Berlin have been head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
therefore prisoners are included over and over again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to m@@ all@@ ots it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Agency , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the opinion of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will be able to receive a million refugees according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federation ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as was built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : between 60 000 and 80@@ 000 social apartments are coming out of the rental price every year , and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to be created a year and the federal government should invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Building agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Sch@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turning point : from the prohibition of labour for refugees in recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residence permit , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - there is a majority in the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view of the Thr@@ es@@ hardt of the Royal Road to work @-@ integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few parent @-@ fle@@ dged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is first of all important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin sen@@ ate administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for teachers in the large number of refugees is increasing , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the capacity for training - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seek@@ ers could be facilit@@ ated to access university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or de@@ af do not receive services after the asylum application law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ lu@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons .
patient @-@ tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ lu@@ g , shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this financing gap must also be closed , by calling for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should step by step with Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights belong to the rights as well .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concerns on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , and the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention commit to Germany must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees expected so far , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery wants to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers alike .
services rendered may later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barrier possible .
even so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more aware of their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be accepted .
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical start @-@ ups in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more untreated de@@ formi@@ ties among refugee children , and in the youth it is about HIV education .
with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training , but clearly says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and take some ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estim@@ ations of the Federal Patent Office ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boat is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from among other things the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ hes , and fears of death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
so far only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill people seeking asylum in the social offices can apply for psycho@@ therapy , treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would usually decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick of the v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , trainer and junior boss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ esis stage is under this motto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept .
50 towns on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to ease their lives .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is intended to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ age , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
sn@@ ak@@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated by her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all their heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances every day from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
the programme starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also gri@@ eved by the opposition &apos;s asser@@ tions that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with bu@@ stling .
last month , they rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them of disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that isn &apos;t shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members that immunity ends in the Parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to employ 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a strain of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on the provision of previously un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in the light of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain at the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league matches in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope that his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need it to take a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal is clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has started in the last season , Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has won the lesson from the previous season with the champi@@ ons League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is evident , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate as ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed by social media , with its emphasis on substance @-@ based substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health far more profound .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football coaching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
as an employee of the phone pastoral ministry explained to me : ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ mur@@ der@@ ous has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who took the French champion down , but after that , they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was sto@@ op@@ ed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing@@ ed door was referred to as the man that PS@@ G was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went in to Marco Ver@@ gu@@ ano &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed on Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic hit in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ ette with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to the attack .
instead PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ asses and bad clu@@ es , last but not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill@@ ful when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the posts ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and within a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down , before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collect $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the G@@ ore Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling stock as part of its vast debt settlement plan .
the London registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about € 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning when trading on the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the $ 2.5 billion stock sale as part of the broader plans to til@@ de around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new investments to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25th September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state machine after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will be the opportunity to expand American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington , before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i are addressing a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion champion , two times champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship in front of the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça is selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered version of the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ bl@@ ings wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for it works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ l@@ ard &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds sprang out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she doesn &apos;t need it behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ took when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it when filling the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on insured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white stock@@ holder .
the producer of Dear White People focused on the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the death of a white polic@@ eman Michael Brown in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement was effective and forced legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured people .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated album of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports climbing and aid aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or earned more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates anything about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received lots of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not especially funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb inside a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League in Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ paste .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inner ring for 6 times and made three raid .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit play since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ paste . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good while ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three of us in the back meeting at the end of the seventh position , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left front@@ line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ or to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run crack .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third B@@ enny Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double @-@ play .
it was the 27th consecutive time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , st@@ acks S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his Fi@@ fth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an un@@ movable Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three of us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes handed out a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not strike particularly well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s right @-@ handed man .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter shoulders .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder closure , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be removed from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing in the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be lod@@ ged there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , according to the government pres@@ i@@ ding committee responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective abor@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict faces our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls both southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced checks on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , but no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding allocation of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people more strongly .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also be given to them .
but if you have no perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this point of view was shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border with Romania to tie down with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to the e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants have re@@ port@@ edly made their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds mentioned En@@ cel@@ i@@ dus a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon ro@@ ams easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this movement is only small , but too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a Communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to do without offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama lam@@ ented pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ ben@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ matched professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties , however , initially presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ h@@ unter Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to go into running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h at the head .
contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ess@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
the person eating the fruits thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day the fo@@ eh@@ n sometimes blows through the herd si@@ re with storm strength .
on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west @-@ stream .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows on Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ ood valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate into the adjacent centre of the centre and even or@@ cans of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away at the Alpine hill@@ side .
this is where rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , after a large amount of rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n leaves the air , as a result , a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland rolls .
together with the cold front , the wind gets strong up to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures are falling mark@@ edly .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the South it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
with the place , in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) visited Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a lost sin @-@ be@@ ak .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden crown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown is one of the main works Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , in current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
this jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to have a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been an up@@ bringing with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop working to bring myself back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ affir@@ m the art of art in the quick@@ ness of time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; inv@@ ade &quot; the images , let them work on themselves , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost took on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; I have always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not care to complete the Bible completely , but chosen the mysterious subjects that are important for him .
&quot; that was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , space found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished again .
failures in politics and administration cared for displacement , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the first municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will be more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break @-@ break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 and the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in addressing the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23 , he plans to discuss the situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the crucial course must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the margins of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals spend a clear indication if they are to be carried on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) , the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European qualification match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides € 300@@ ,000 for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent , and then dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Plat@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you are gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren air@@ pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as a reserve seaf@@ ar@@ er in Singapore on the weekend just as little as a reserve @-@ driver for the two regular @-@ pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button wonder how a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us have definitely broken up in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga football league in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t resort to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be there again on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga Top@@ match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal man Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be in use in all European League matches , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open .
with high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ me statement by Mit@@ sten Re@@ us that the final cat@@ ch@@ ment for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is to keep mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl navig@@ able : &quot; Marco is not so wrong with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Transport Ministry &apos;s strategic paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio systems .
a test track is currently being developed on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risks of liability be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use approximately internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically feasible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audi@@ ting organization Dek@@ ra means that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be able to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect 33 percent of autonomous cars in the United States until 20@@ 25 .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads .
at least 15 per cent could be present on the motorway , and 45 per cent in traffic jams .
well , every fourth would leave the car under control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis championship
from 25th September to 4th October , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only open its doors to the individual .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship event in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the cast list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo fled , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that seem frigh@@ tening human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been made : to fr@@ ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have m@@ apped 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ atively fashionable contents of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past we used the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops emerged in large quantities for customers , which they , for example , processed into blankets and she@@ ers .
that alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic eras , becomes an increasing order potential .
those who do not serve ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 per cent of sales were broken .
private specialist shops and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
export is also weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ Per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace making .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there is an area of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow ball point .
in the process , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to do with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of memory .

EU wants to double mercury levels in pre@@ dat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus increase consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significantly higher dose of the nerve cell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch , the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury today that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watches , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal which is heavily enriched in pre@@ dat@@ ors through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly due to the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants em@@ it more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
