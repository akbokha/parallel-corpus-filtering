&quot; every state turns against the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to carry out the tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privileg@@ es and Gui@@ delines of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; securing measures according to these agreements are concluded regarding core material when the community and the organization detect that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer use@@ able for a nuclear activity , which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to this Convention the transfer of nuclear material from the States which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention .
&quot; the security measures according to these agreements are terminated in respect to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for it . &quot;
the organisation carries documents from which any disclosure and if necessary the re @-@ application of securing measures on the given core material .
&quot; core material , securing measures according to this agreement , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the community agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated according to this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material used in the duration of non @-@ application of the securing measures according to this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives .
B ) The organisation and the Community shall regulate the provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for so long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security measures fores@@ een in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the relevant state or the respective states and about any passing on such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it covers only matters such as temporal and process @-@ based determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or a knowledge of military activity , and does not include the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the association , the states or persons who are subject to their authority , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation ref@@ uses to reimbur@@ se these costs insofar as it has clari@@ fied beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the organisation carries out the cost of all additional measurements and sampling frames required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the warran@@ t protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used according to its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the Community or the State is asser@@ ted against the organization or the organization against the Community or the State for Dam@@ age - with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident - is governed by the implementation of the securing measures according to this Convention is regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; after the examination of the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council shall certi@@ fy that no core material which must be subject to safety precau@@ tions must be provided for nuclear weapons or other nuclear br@@ is , so it may take the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ ute and possibly take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the employed security measures , takes into account the Community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is affected - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be concluded with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , which shall not be submitted in the negotiation process or by another by the organisation , the Community and the states , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two refer@@ ees , the organization also names two refer@@ ees , and the four so named arbit@@ rators elect a fifth , which pres@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not designated two arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the association or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbit@@ rators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected yet .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the Organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall stand for non @-@ nuclear countries , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; II ) when the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures concerning this State , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All amendments require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director will immediately notify all Member States of the Organization from any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are completed . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force so long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this section of the Convention is to determine the procedures necessary for the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely identification of the junc@@ tions of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a junction by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to reach the goal specified in article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ung with spatial integration and monitoring as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical completion of tests by the organization takes place by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance sheet is specified for a certain period of time under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
&quot; when performing their investigations , the organisation will make full use of the community after article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their securing measures , the Community of de Procedure and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following manner and , as far as necessary , see how they are determined and condu@@ ci@@ ve in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of retained , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stocks of core material and stock ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Procedure for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) Procedure for the evaluation of accumulation of un@@ measured invent@@ ories and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and report system , which displays the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) provisions ensuring that the accounting procedures and arrangements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or in ore treatment .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) has not yet reached the states , so the organization of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase where it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle produced in the states , it is subject to the securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled or desired , the Community is provisional or desirable , so the organization and the community consult each other about the use of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically not re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material if it is used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities under Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material that would otherwise be subject to safety measures according to the Convention , provided that the entire material quantity delivered by this article in the states amounts to no more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment that is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ ve@@ fold squar@@ ed of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; exemp@@ ted core material is to be processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to , processes , or stored the securing measures after this agreement , so precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material are taken . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the Organisation after this Convention , in particular , as the procedures set out in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without changing this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the incorpor@@ ation between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report described in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization provides a summar@@ ised inventory of the entire core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EC@@ TION following GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources of resources . &quot;
&quot; C ) The objective of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; d ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement , and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special action account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is defined by the organization as a st@@ ew@@ ard , and in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is governed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state to the Order of the Organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the organization of the organization in the country in question . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry bin@@ nen 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administr@@ ative appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time stipulated between the EEC and the administrator considering the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned appointments .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the st@@ ew@@ ard takes about disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate accor@@ ds on cash or the notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and equi@@ p the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the event of gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EE@@ A : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit absorption capacity for loan terms without any benefits ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the affected countries can be governed by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly issu@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral prepar@@ edness ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are to be taken into account for the purposes stated by the organization financed by the Organisation ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are general terms for the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in only 10 years in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for payment of this fee are to be paid directly to the organization that preser@@ ves it .
&quot; each transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the income from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or provided by the administrators at the time of loan grant , recipients of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible . &quot;
the st@@ ew@@ ard will inform the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors until full awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans granted by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special transaction loans , the administrator reports the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses for this purpose . &quot;
the administrator transfers the EE@@ A as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
&quot; after a full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC will forward as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are depos@@ ited from the account balances to the account depos@@ ited and depos@@ ited out of the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete edition of the special transaction account of time @-@ to @-@ time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action groups and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it will be due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the entire amount of capital of all the benef@@ ici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
member States Govern@@ ments are notified to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these Not@@ i@@ fications together with an Not@@ i@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement is effective and comes into force on the first day of the month , following the day of receipt of the mentioned not@@ ions in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two sentences in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ UNG :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this programme includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; - are transferred . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; because up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive works are carried out , it is in the interest of the agreement parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ise their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , resulting in the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effective power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Swiss Programme &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss Programme under@@ takes the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities that are relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contractual parties accept a new program , this is the place of the programmes listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories included on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; in the context of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties include an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those established between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom &apos;s objective is to ensure that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; agreements on personnel exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET Project , Switzerland is part of the date of entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint Company J@@ ET , whose Statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar agreements concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the current agreement . &quot;
the executive bodies charged with carrying out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement must , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of the research work , and to ste@@ er the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , takes on this task as regards all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Procedure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ors that make the VG research proposals under@@ line that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development work , which is refer@@ enced in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , which over@@ sees the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the scope of the programme are optimally utilized , with regard to all research and development work carried out under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to attend the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees that provide appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , staff , and knowledge and skills on which the laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program take into account all research and development work carried out under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country , responsible for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programmes and defining its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the VG &apos;s statement on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee &apos;s committee in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two Parties shall work on the works of all technical @-@ consult@@ ative bodies or all administrative committees that are created for the purposes of this agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is fixed annually to an amount of the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland as@@ signs an amount to the Common Company J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for financing work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to fund the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the commission divi@@ des the Federal Council at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year which is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year .
the Federal Council pays the commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are laid down in Annex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland is sei@@ zing all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or acquired there , items may not be sold free of charge in this country , unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves the conditions which the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to herds of herds and bodies that are paid to these persons .

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with Hamm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I ad@@ ore myself to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or ch@@ illed mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; under this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina after the Community are set to the following yearly quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in batt@@ les@@ hip weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount agreed upon does not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community demands protection clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access of Argentina to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement to a sc@@ atter@@ ing rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount laid down under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States are stipulated in accordance with the provisions of the Ac@@ cession Agreement ; this is taken into account under the number 5 above @-@ mentioned sc@@ rut@@ iny of the de@@ ple@@ tion .
&quot; the total amount referred to as number 2 is set to 23@@ ,000 tons of batt@@ les@@ hips with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community . &quot;
&quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine mut@@ ton and lamb on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community takes precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine mut@@ ton and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other funding measures for the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , must be in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by gran@@ ting the amount of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its part , the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina dependent on the submission of an export license which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for issu@@ ing the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; furthermore , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals has filed the amounts for which export licenses have been granted ; these details may be en@@ forced upon destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the Hamm@@ el , lamb and the labour market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the terms of sales in these markets , including the conditions that are important for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out under the agreement under the agreement . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss any questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends adequate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual quantity fixed under number 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and in accordance with the agreement on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until March 31 , 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to announce it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes that they consider necessary for approval . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would disclose the consent of your government to this .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I ad@@ ore myself to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand into the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb are existing after the world market and in particular after the Community for the New Zealand economy , and that it must be ensured that the normal paragraph of New Zealand mut@@ ton and lamb is not affected on these markets , I agree to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - Fresh or ch@@ illed mut@@ ton , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;

containers and inf@@ usion devices are to be lab@@ elled with an English and French label used in English and French which corresponds to the sample included in the plants 2 to 10 .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred can only be disp@@ at@@ ched in containers in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C during the whole transport .
&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
it is recommended to add the equipment necessary for inf@@ usion as well as the solvents for dry preparations .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is a healthy human being taken away and blood mixed with a suitable anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
C ) which are not free of disease transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; blood sampling takes place as@@ ep@@ tic ; blood is sli@@ pped into a ster@@ ile bottle by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system , in which the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was introduced before sterili@@ sation . &quot;
&quot; after the bleeding is over , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C. After@@ wards it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not fall to 97 g per litre .
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to determine the blood cells and the ser@@ um beforehand ; the determination of the blood cell is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as it is standardized or recommended for the determination of blood groups in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used when specific investigations have resulted in the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged according to this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle from micro @-@ organisms and can withstand up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C. Higher temperatures are permissible only during the times necessary for testing and transport , which may amount to a maximum of 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is immediately cooled to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma was removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cells can be present or may have been removed partially .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the residual plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ered solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is to be added to the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the support must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively through pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ered solution has been added , so on the label can also specify its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , which is depos@@ ited at the top with centri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human full blood . &quot;
human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that is used in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the solution thus won cannot be less than 45 g per liter and the solution must not contain visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) have been found a dangerous content of is@@ oh@@ em@@ oly@@ sin or immune hem@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood sampling , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood flow of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the dam@@ aging effect of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood don@@ ates are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood flow of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transferring I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ ic to the plasma sector , mixtures are not included , which do not contain more than 12 don@@ ors , or other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , the amount of water used in the production of the plasma is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C. &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum Plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the liquid quantity made from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ ine or calcium chlori@@ de is necessary 1 ml solution , t@@ inn@@ ing occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C . &quot;
the 24@@ hours drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ox@@ ides in the presence of a maximum of 0.@@ 02 mm of mer@@ cury may not occur in human dry plasma weight loss over 0.5 % .
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle with exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and after possibility of any moisture ; it is protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are preparations of the protein component from which approximately 60 % of the total prot@@ ru@@ sion of the plasma of the human full blood consist .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be t@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation must have been heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours in the final container for 10 hours in order to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in preparations of a human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing protein alb@@ um@@ in need to be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
in both preparations no more than 10 mg immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present .
&quot; if the final product fre@@ eze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the fraction is made of human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 grams per litre . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; measurements of viscosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are made before and after heating to the solutions , may not result in any signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating on 57 C and six @-@ piece bulk bags in a mechanical sha@@ ker at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The for@@ gery tests with specific anti @-@ sera have to show that only human plasma proteins are contained in both preparations ;
&quot; the electro@@ phor@@ esis represented by free @-@ floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions must show that the protein fraction , which is the mobility of the alb@@ um@@ ina component of the normal human plasma , is at least 95 % of the protein proteins of the human plasma proteins at least 85 % of the proteins . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is homogen@@ ous to the antibodies or other substance on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly th@@ inning the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is exclusively calculated by volume of the amount of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are currently working out standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per m@@ g. or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ans that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups in most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational tender observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions during er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flus@@ hing .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors according to definition 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative tit@@ ration of the international standard ser@@ um anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ vial form according to label lies at the most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date used on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf @-@ life tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ox@@ ides at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ essi@@ gen or re@@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in any form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups should not be treated as arti@@ fici@@ ally as possible , at least until an International Convention came about via a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the amount in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; adequate specimens of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part ; the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effective share . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each single container is a black printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of liquid required for re @-@ solving , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or the label on the cardboard box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions provided to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 3. the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of liquid required for re @-@ solving , &quot;
each con@@ sign@@ ment must be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this Protocol .

&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not exceed 64 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of a@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the once dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group A which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .

an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative agent against a re@@ formation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a quantity of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double period of time , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group 0 who can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .

&quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative agent against a re@@ formation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not exceed 64 international units per ml . &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , this is necessary if the same attempts are performed with the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double period of time , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the once dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are em@@ itted in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determination of the R@@ h group may possibly change if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;

&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific to the C an@@ tigen only when the blood cells are tested in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells .

&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the propor@@ tion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;

&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS , it depends on its cultivation the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which , for its part , entirely depend on the measures taken to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producers themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to olive oil and table olive oil , essential ingredients in the fields in which olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the fact that the essential feature of the olive @-@ production is the un@@ regul@@ arity of the harv@@ ests and the market supply and that this leads to variations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers of producers ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the fact that this causes all particular difficulties , seriously dam@@ aging the interests of producers and consumers and endanger@@ ing the general policy of economic growth in countries that are common in zones where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
