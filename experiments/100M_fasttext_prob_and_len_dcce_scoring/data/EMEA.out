&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ ori@@ zation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the treatment template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Enter@@ ing thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients have several episodes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal high spirits ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to take or the tablets to treat patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are also degra@@ ded as A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted to A@@ bili@@ fy dosage .
&quot; this imp@@ airs the transmission of signals between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but lower than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters to activate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain activity , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurring . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , who suffered increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ i@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurring , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with the plac@@ ebo reported by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the changes in patients &apos; symptoms were examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ ted the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to take up ( absorbed ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased un@@ eas@@ iness than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ ring of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal dys@@ functions ( continuous motion ) , trem@@ ors ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( sleep@@ iness ) , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( sleep@@ iness ) , irrit@@ ation , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium to heavy man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes and out@@ weigh the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the market launch of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; if patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , treated with A@@ bili@@ fy should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or cancel the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ n , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study involving a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related unwanted events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ ative agents , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central acting drugs with itself over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ aboli@@ sers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in reproductive studies during pregnancy , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ isie , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled trial of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ vas@@ cular treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose deaths , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein binding . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ron Emis@@ sions Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents responded to the study medi@@ ation in week 52 , similar to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ min@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ rats Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the down@@ fall rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared versus plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not result in lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium and val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 . in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over 74 weeks before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ regulation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabolism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ aboli@@ sers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with severe liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ ot@@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogenic potential the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to the recommended maximum dose in humans ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle @-@ ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l not more than 6 % of concentrations found in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold the mid @-@ range Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for the dispens@@ ing of single boxes made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over 74 weeks before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor recept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over 74 weeks before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 . in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l over 74 weeks before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the enam@@ el tablets to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ ative agents , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;

the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the medicine ( * ) :
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rent episodes in patients who have received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related unwanted events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Ex@@ ter@@ ior a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold the mid @-@ range Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of Mount and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under@@ going adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status under consideration of the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy sm@@ elt tablets or abili@@ fy solution for inclusion . &quot;
there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with gra@@ d@@ iness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ ative agents , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater than that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly applied and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ aboli@@ sers , compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly obtained the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater than that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were pre@@ valent in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose deaths , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of Agi@@ ok@@ it@@ eness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of the Mount plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe comp@@ act@@ ness , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the aggregate population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents responded to the study medi@@ ation in week 52 , similar to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the down@@ fall rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not result in lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium and val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % higher the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time required to achieve the maximum plasma treatment was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the offering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogenic potential the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceed the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3- to 10 @-@ times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters of which had previously obtained anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer were treated for the first time , there was no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or having low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was patient in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective , effective as conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ sion Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted , until improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients suffering from imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on dosage adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound hem@@ op@@ ar@@ it@@ em@@ ulate formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which might have different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no recur@@ r@@ ence treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils are risen again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , kar@@ mic incidents in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ative methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of prevention for up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
&quot; before treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ ges@@ tion , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the most common and most important incidents of adverse events occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with abrasion and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the offering of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules drug that promotes the contrac@@ tion of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ ses mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ colon@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and is due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs .
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two consecutive , un@@ blind@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abra@@ x@@ ane , given in the form of an inf@@ usion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion of 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated by the improvement of one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy in grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the ring on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi@@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or leg@@ ality binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ic ex@@ cre@@ tion of the un@@ modified active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for placing on the market before the market launch is provided by the healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging support . • With a clear imaging of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport through patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , where blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur if a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml should occur prior to the procedure . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ections can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and reduce the consequences of loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enabled them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as inj@@ ections into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side @-@ side mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ sec@@ amed has shown that the medicine shows comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ sec@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Pharmaceuticals P@@ ütter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion exists due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions , which require large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce bor@@ rowing from a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults without a lack of iron where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed in a patient via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dosage management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week via intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with dosage increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dosage management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest allowed dose , which is required for controlling an@@ es@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained once a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the base value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ges@@ tion is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be obtained twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week before the surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Epo@@ xy al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ eric sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ per ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke during one month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ en ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial vas@@ cular disease , vas@@ cular disease of car@@ ot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ antibody PR@@ CA after months of long @-@ term treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as reducing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers should be determined and a investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be assessed for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown significant benefits derived from epo@@ et@@ ins when ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased to the concentration required for controlling the symptoms of an@@ es@@ emia and avoiding blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an underlying car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , for patients with an initial binary value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events may occur . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that they can improve overall survival for tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding ha@@ emat@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events like m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ verteb@@ rates , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ died events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; irrespective of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the end@@ ogen@@ ous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an em@@ ic patient . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ ovi@@ ch did not influence .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ H@@ od@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer cells , 23 bron@@ ch@@ os@@ car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 breast car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ or@@ blast . &quot;
survival and progression have been studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and the patient . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal studies with approximate 20 times of the week dose recommended for use in humans recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a dimin@@ ished fine body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uns@@ afe signature for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ sen@@ amed one @-@ time for a period of a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the amount of blood counts , which re@@ forms with further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ sec@@ amed before the start of therapy . &quot;

&quot; in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assium , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for assess@@ ing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .

&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully before the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumour . &quot;
if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent before treatment start with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of hi@@ dro@@ pping after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building up the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood sugar ( an@@ emia ) appe@@ als to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine acts correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you get regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will be able to arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and to ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .

&quot; if a sy@@ ringe is taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) for women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the h@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or through injection into a muscle before the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; in the trial with older women , the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % for patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years . &quot;
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared with all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) .
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s manufacturer provides inform@@ ational material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment plant • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing aid &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long period of removal was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced shortly after using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is missing for safety and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ei@@ a@@ emia should be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick release of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed before using bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatments with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical review by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced shortly after using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; incidence of cau@@ tious complications reported cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before administration ) and the incidence of ren@@ al failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on evaluating the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values reported below the normal oscill@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports relates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental treatment . &quot;
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area in one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosage , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a frac@@ ture coefficient ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase in the lum@@ bar density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the total hip by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ n@@ ct ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the maintenance of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
&quot; bone turnover mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an intake dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times compared to plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was not inferior to the once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , above all mild to moderate heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens ( middle ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ dent at the end of the six month trial ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study evaluated the therapeutic response at 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar rapidly decreased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half @-@ life cycle t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ -@@ 146 hours .
&quot; the early dividing phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a decreased clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems metaboli@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans , and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ versible , nutrient @-@ related inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min without dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney function disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- law &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C are the six times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous use was measured in rats of 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the times of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended Human exposure , occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as on the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the degra@@ ded ser@@ um @-@ calcium levels .
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by restoring bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs which are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and drink , you are worried that you take sufficient fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the hip break . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or more . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low during the time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if you missed the appointment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; before finishing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , consider ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please feel your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at present it is uncle@@ ar whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have considerably imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
&quot; due to the quick release of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the treatment template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? it The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract n@@ g The complete list of the side effects reported in the context of A@@ compli@@ a is the prescription label . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can be caused , among other things , in a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight in@@ cis@@ ions
&quot; medicines used in patients who require it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied and in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; not investigated by ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ) , it is assumed that the simultaneous administration of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tors the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with obesity have been examined and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that have occurred under treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and for accompanying metabolic disorders .
&quot; if the incidence is statisti@@ cally significant , the corresponding plac@@ ebo ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a tolerance study where a limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and one simultaneously existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year ran@@ ged for A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg 6,5 kg , relative to the base value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4,@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ap@@ compli@@ a 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in the total weight reduction was between A@@ compli@@ a and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4,@@ 2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average waste of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen by 6.9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under plac@@ ebo I
the percentage of patients with a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . LN &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients that had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z
&quot; reach 2 hours , the Ste@@ ady State Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel was reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1.6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; influence of food : he subjects who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in in@@ timi@@ dity or after a fat @-@ rich meal , increased C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin color may have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a reduced 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ k@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered potentially relevant to clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be associated with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ ori@@ zation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with sulph@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ide or insulin can be retained , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sulph@@ onic acid or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phone resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phone resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin received a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who received additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ al ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may respond hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirror - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is inadequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study involving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ matic values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , alter@@ ation , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver enzy@@ matic values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the laboratory parameters are pre@@ determined by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which may be ag@@ itated by fat deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) appeared under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies involving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ og@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ og@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ cell or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic diagnosis should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across thre@@ e@@ fold increased the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ ate resin . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with advanced Mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events with random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ utilization in the case of insulin resistance increases .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value of 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values was performed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as mar@@ ginal but clin@@ ically non @-@ significant L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed . &quot;

&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

&quot; following oral use of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fall ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elim@@ inations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies were consistent with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and re@@ versible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal in the gest@@ ation , reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced . &quot;

calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de , were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents in comparison to the bas@@ eline values was performed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;

&quot; ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human@@ insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who might respond hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar setting has significantly improved by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the initial dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions during the treatment and his patients always ask for other medicines taken by them .

ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin which is long acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , it may be necessary at the initial dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General conditions and complaints at the place of delivery gel @-@ tu@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection point Wh@@ ile the insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ dening , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients , who undergo larger surgical procedures , has shown that mort@@ ality reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active time is about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
&quot; however , the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion systems with ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in inf@@ usion fluids 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l pot@@ assium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature . &quot;
&quot; 11 If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , it may be necessary at the initial dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

this can happen : • If you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you do more than otherwise physically
always set the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s pen whenever it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ up@@ fer • Use a new injection needle for each injection • Scre@@ w the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Drag the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle to the top .
&quot; if air bub@@ bles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Wh@@ ile the injection needle continues to be pushed upwards , press the button in the whole ( Figure B ) • Now the tip of the injection needle will need a drop of insulin . &quot;
• Place the cap on the pen so that the digit 0 is compared to the metering mark ( Figure D ) • Check if the pressure button is pressed completely .
&quot; if the pressure button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outw@@ ards while you turn the closing cap • The scale below the push button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 • Record the highest number that you can see at the push of a button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
turn it down until the pressure button is down@@ wards and you feel a resistance then take off the cap and set it up again that the 0 of the metering mark is over .
be sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the push button after injection completely squee@@ zed until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
&quot; it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of crystal de@@ formations including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ alli@@ zations that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks may still occur , so it is recommended that patients receive further medicines for the prevention of g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study to take part in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients received 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who received 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history may also be increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ation ( including one of the medical history known or currently available g@@ loss@@ ary and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully examined ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- surface &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents There are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient population . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient population ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , it may come to an acute po@@ ison during the treatment , because it is possible to mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ace . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it leads to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before beginning of the Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ atin treatment and in the course of the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war did not have an exchange @-@ effect studies on Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous dose of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in February exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ . ost@@ at may be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at or any other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ano@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous use of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ ther@@ a , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed the inclusion of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not include side @-@ effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when performing dangerous activities , until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not adver@@ sely affected by their performance . &quot;
&quot; a higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at treatment groups . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common among patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ . ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ de@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ aes@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ion , erectile dysfunction , decrease in T@@ SH concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te numbers , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , the mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the Re@@ action sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhibit@@ ing located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ age level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .

primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dysfunction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the decrease of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ c acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ c acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 revealed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es ( i.e. , more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a po@@ ison ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out h@@ ubs , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out node to month 24 . &quot;
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose are dose @-@ propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at that is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ son@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after ing@@ es@@ tion of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma bonding of Feb@@ son@@ ost@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a dose of 80 mg of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ed Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as imm@@ utable Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , acet@@ ate glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ ate glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the middle total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at decreased about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and ur@@ inary composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were approximately 4.3 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ tung and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 revealed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es ( i.e. , more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a po@@ ison ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk for low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceutical products approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who received Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at only ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company also presented data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ tuous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and sour slo@@ ping . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand up or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE marketing in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to frac@@ tured white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed up with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al structures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore alert all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine in case of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients , which do not take the medicine correctly and / or it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions can be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , it was rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severely and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime mainly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ onate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , which indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a late surgical intervention , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet in the next morning during the om@@ ission of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet per week as originally planned at the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to treatment .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in clinical trials was jointly used with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate have no indication of direct harmful effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
&quot; ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholesterol to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ fig D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

after 15 @-@ week treatment the middle ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / l &#93; ) as in the group under Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( decrease of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic level@@ ness of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mid @-@ asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D filled with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8,@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5,@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the con@@ sol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved with the percentage of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D from the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued , including the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) :
&quot; in this study the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7,@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours prior to intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .

&quot; although there are no clinical data on it , it is still to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients , who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which transplan@@ tation was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , more studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension , hyper@@ tension , and in@@ som@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain whi@@ tish powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescription this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or of the regime should be carried out only under close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustments need to be performed to ensure that systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurement ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
&quot; after the change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ spiegel should be controlled after the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure measured as a level mirror , with both form@@ ulations , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral consumption in the first postoperative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily application in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily application in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) . &quot;
&quot; after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose must be recommended for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recep@@ tions in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function . in patients with severe liver function a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ oma , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ contin@@ ence and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level mirror in full blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical app@@ rais@@ al of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in an individual case with the aid of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low checks .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ level mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can be concluded that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tal@@ low level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tions , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or super@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or of the regime should be carried out only under close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tions and transplan@@ t recep@@ tions in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical efficacy of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ trophy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under section agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ burden and o@@ est@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disorders should demonstrate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution is required . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that can be metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be especially cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , it is recommended to monitor the new@@ born on any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 New@@ born , i.e. : &quot;
the supplementary performance profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not precisely determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; adverse events are shown below in descending order ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

cases of B@@ Cs @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign Ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding on er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and phar@@ ma @-@ dynamic effects on a molecular level should medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular inside . &quot;
this results in cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f , applied twice daily , has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
175 patients transplan@@ ted to 4@@ 75 patients who undergo a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ tation as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies revealed the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tions to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung Transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis via a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study involving oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported in a 1 : 1 random@@ isation either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis in 21.@@ 7 % was compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients that were changed from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no gra@@ ft rejection after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patients transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the incidence of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ates syn@@ dro@@ ms with the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
&quot; P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multic@@ entri@@ c study involving oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients , who were treated at the same time a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was followed after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed a current rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ital aug@@ mentation , additional administration of inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ists d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to tal@@ kers between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
factors such as a low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit value and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rati@@ os observed after the transplan@@ t .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) compared to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) compared to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack of blood cl@@ ots , such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from a human plasma but is produced using a method called &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , Adv@@ ate &apos;s effectiveness in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes has been awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for the adoption of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ical events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma gas ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plastic is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be administered . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , to achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that the VIII @-@ therapy factor is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII by Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine which is quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ite @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low ti@@ tre ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s present in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which have all patients treated previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ Inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or was established . &quot;
&quot; in the previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated from the appearance of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ytes in multiple repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the factor VIII active factor acts as a factor factor for the active factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline factor of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters originate from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously untreated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; each single package consists of a pier@@ cing bottle with powder , a pier@@ cing bottle with 5 ml of solvents ( both jar type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber stop@@ pers ) and a device for pro@@ stitution ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ ECT II ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefits risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has approved its application for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that was gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which was so modified that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken in the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the sub @-@ construction , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP examined the answers of the company on the questions he asked , some questions were still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; based on examining the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the nature of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; modified active substances &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergi@@ es to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , have been deduc@@ ted . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who deser@@ ted Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , sleep@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vas@@ cular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the aviation of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed intact ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors like bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , per@@ go@@ id , per@@ go@@ amine , cot@@ ox@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosing .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment should be canc@@ eled in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be carried out at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
&quot; during clinical trials involving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness , or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal trials . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , shock@@ ing micro , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , per@@ spir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , just like at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion of adhesion to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study involving adults , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flu@@ idity , including reinforcement of subjective per@@ sever@@ ance or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was detected . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ ist effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the fluid balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dos@@ sier study , which was carried out with formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four persons were dis@@ car@@ at@@ ad@@ ine bad . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ist studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ate the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 ml Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; in total , A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies involving seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to verify that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the tablets in the same way as tablets and use in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , there was a decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted the European Commission a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous illness process and may be terminated following the end of the symptoms and res@@ um@@ ed at their re@@ occurring .
&quot; in the case of persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy period a continuing treatment . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials involving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be informed that in very rare cases it may come to be ligh@@ the@@ aded , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness , or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 pregnant patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse event head@@ ache . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion of adhesion of P sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses administered in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measuring ranges of flu@@ idity , including reinforcement of subjective per@@ sever@@ ance or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall outcome of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; as the hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ anti@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine also leads to an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis @-@ population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was reached in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo non @-@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study involving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical trials performed using Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains L@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , Tit@@ anium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have been metaboli@@ zed dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experienced higher substance exposure ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children from 2 to 11 years of age that is restricted to metaboli@@ ze is identical to those in children who normally metaboli@@ ze .
&quot; this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group at the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily loss dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents reported no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or activity in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous use of alcohol did not lead to boo@@ sting alcohol @-@ induced impair@@ ment or increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as illustrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater with Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults receiving the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ glass bottles with a child @-@ proof polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ s@@ ats dose must be taken out without dam@@ aging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with ap@@ eri@@ us tablets per day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat was well toler@@ ated for inclusion ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was detected . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study involving adults , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flu@@ idity , including reinforcement of subjective per@@ sever@@ ance or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall outcome of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergi@@ es . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be taken without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and turned not significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el treated as bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for the neh@@ men@@ - formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study involving adults , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed no influence on standard measuring variables of flu@@ idity , including reinforcement of subjective per@@ sever@@ ance or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with dos@@ sier studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the safety of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children from 2 to 11 years of age that is restricted to metaboli@@ ze is identical to those in children who normally metaboli@@ ze .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more commonly than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ onally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater with Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration on Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine contains , there was no bio @-@ equivalent study required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
in different single dose studies AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company has approved its application for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should be protected from a stem of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu epide@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans , because people have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus included in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce more antibodies in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane she@@ ath of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body det@@ ects as a body foreign ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for prev@@ ent@@ ative vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus of Type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take @-@ in , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended adult dose is based on body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV quantity in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; aids not cure , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases connected with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug , which was dos@@ ed with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with 206 adults who used early prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks of A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; children reduced the viral load , although children who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ Gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generations may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicinal products that are degra@@ ded in the same way as am@@ eth@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( de@@ dying of bone tissue ) or an immune reaction syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat the HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years over the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ritual avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information was given at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the transport of A@@ gar@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ atal capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying additive from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of am@@ using ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generative Cap@@ sules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ m 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy may not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis demonstrate increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ co@@ ster@@ oids which are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time can be less effective due to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reduced plasma gas ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ t of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was reported on the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exposure to an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were required for their therapy medications associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with disease . &quot;
ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ emat@@ omas .
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections may develop , which leads to serious clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ m 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with drugs , whose agents are metaboli@@ zed mainly via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma gas with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma gas through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , most frequently undes@@ ired effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ pren@@ atal mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the cur@@ rant . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials dosage of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and ritual vi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % decreases when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg rite level twice daily ) was administered .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s C@@ min values achieved twice a day in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see address below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r possibly .
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be carried out as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below include sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as a@@ generation , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ dation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ ël pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
&quot; simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which ritual avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in test persons , the end@@ ogen@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma gas increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these Glu@@ k@@ oc@@ or@@ tik@@ oids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of plasma gas at the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; because plasma concentrations of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while offering am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma gas from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low perme@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , greater control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in milk lac@@ tation rats am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproductive study of pregnant rats administered from the on@@ set into uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the immun@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events associated with A@@ gener@@ ase were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment termination . &quot;
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment applied or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
&quot; most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medicine , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment arising from the treatment ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat collection ( j@@ acks ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre @-@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a medi@@ an duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ er@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable with the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were received very often in patients who received the A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient should observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ pre@@ stages with the result of a formation of un@@ mature , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in un@@ infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - like other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r chemotherapy regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 5@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always tigh@@ ten the current interpretation systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; due to phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of resistance testing .
&quot; each of them with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains intact . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients in which a f@@ os@@ amp@@ ar @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ ar and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ate ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ritual avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ stert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ gen@@ s@@ threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 years of age 152 of which were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dos@@ sier was given at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in treatment optimisation with PI previously treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore the minimal concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ fet@@ ched am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which is the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bonded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval according to the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state across the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ atal exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram@@ mar basis .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma s@@ cones comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas near dos@@ ages , following twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there was little evidence for the adoption of the clinical relevance of these findings from these exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse utation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , M@@ ouse Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as anticipated exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying additive from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of am@@ using ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be adjusted to 27 when a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s C@@ min values achieved twice a day in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be carried out as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ ël pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which ritual avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in test persons , the end@@ ogen@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma gas increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , greater control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproductive study of pregnant rats administered from the on@@ set into uter@@ us up to the end of breast@@ feeding pregnancy was shown during breast@@ feeding a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the after@@ math .
the immun@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient should observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in un@@ infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in cases of chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ate ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account in the treatment of PI previously treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; a@@ generation . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bonded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval according to the overall concentration interval in the ste@@ ady state across the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ic aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there was little evidence for the adoption of the clinical relevance of these findings from the current exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse Mut@@ ation@@ tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , M@@ ouse Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young , the metabolism paths are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not covered with PI previously untreated patients , nor with PI previously treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to take up ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended adult dose is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to be considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col , A@@ generative solution for taking small children and children under 4 years is contra@@ indicated in case of pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk from transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ emat@@ omas .
&quot; it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking up may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in milk lac@@ tation rats am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproductive study of pregnant rats administered from the on@@ set to the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the immun@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment applied or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - like other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r chemotherapy regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data should be considered in treatment optimisation with PI previously treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ tr ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large Vet@@ eg@@ ir@@ radiation volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as anticipated exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream can be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses , it is performed three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were performed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials involving 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ al region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ dered the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;

&quot; in other studies where no daily curtain was performed , two cases of severe p@@ him@@ ose and one case were observed with one to circumc@@ ision leading stro@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ ages , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after the treatment with other perc@@ ut@@ aneous inc@@ enses in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al region , no clinical experiences have yet to be found . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of up@@ side effects in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient population with regard to eradi@@ c@@ ating genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair attachment was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during the therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there are currently no data available on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences are present , therefore the use of previously untreated tum@@ ours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicates that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
only very limited data are available on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after de@@ composition of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient , or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial shows that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

the most frequently communicated and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
most frequently reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III are shown below .
&quot; the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects , were in these studies a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weeks of weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , exc@@ itation ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ der ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is very common to severe Er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , might cause nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically weigh@@ ty side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the top@@ ical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to a complete recovery of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
60 % of total 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients completely ; this was 20 % of 105 with plac@@ ebo therap@@ ist patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete recovery could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od versus 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that around 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically cured and stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three weeks of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ac@@ - les@@ ions within a co@@ hesive 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined watch studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical waste after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ ci@@ dal bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and have therefore not been studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic on@@ set of 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three times weekly use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and prayed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on the MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ pur@@ se bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application also showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on a three days per week induced no tum@@ ours at the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ es , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , inhi@@ bit movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with revit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining the effect of reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B@@ V approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L ion@@ oid bladder and is produced using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term Enzy@@ me Therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with ren@@ al or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which re@@ juven@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; there is little experience concerning res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the case of a moderate or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single serious inf@@ usion @-@ induced reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ) ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Pro@@ c@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which have been exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
adverse reactions in clinical trials were mainly attributed to inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug interactions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breath @-@ down@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ solic@@ ited drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years of age , with predominantly difficult exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the commen@@ cement of the treatment ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and over ) .
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay detected antibodies , including 3 patients where there was never too ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibody levels had a robust reduction of the G@@ AG @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 trial ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy lies in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulate substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute case .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be found in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks there was a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was considered by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant change overall for five efficacy variable ( as expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minutes walking test , motion range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
an open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe running form and 4 with middle evap@@ or@@ ating form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy cross @-@ course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with moderate exp@@ ir@@ ation form showed minimal or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 trial , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients affected by older and less severely affected patients .

&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breath @-@ down@@ s and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very often ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ ness • F@@ fever • Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ frost • Im@@ proved oxygen in the blood • Re@@ duc@@ ed oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the inf@@ usion point &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution proce@@ eded under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • to determine the number of di@@ lution fl@@ asks to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . • Advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and obtain inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood type changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose will be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to share .
&quot; the transformation from P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ial i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin lived average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta increases longer survival times than with the comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ PO@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ size of the cell epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ size and cell epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after conclusion of P@@ emet@@ ric Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid has to be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of por@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last tes@@ tic@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) per week before the first em@@ emet@@ eri@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third operating cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a full blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ases ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ases ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times of the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ - h@@ ending treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ C 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ PO@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value of treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ PO@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 doses of dose , a hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 , or above , in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot;
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min which should go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limits and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ atic count has reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ology , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was carried out if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be instruc@@ ted to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , provided with P@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ ectivity prior to the tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 main car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed exists , men should be advised before the treatment regim@@ en to collect advice regarding sperm production . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) lead to a reduced por@@ emet@@ ric acid separation , resulting in increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; ( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , it must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ odi@@ zed mul@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , heavy labour defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the beginning of treatment , consult with regards to the sperm @-@ con@@ servi@@ ent . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed goes into the breast milk and unwanted effects of breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and were random@@ ised to Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; side effects frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three individual P@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy studies , except neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal starting values of liver function tests .

&quot; clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients were reported , which were radi@@ ated before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ ric therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ aci@@ dity @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies , P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ atin ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ B ) and gly@@ c@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin for cis@@ pl@@ atin with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ MU@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin patients had a clin@@ ically important advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to such patients who were treated only with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medi@@ ation in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural syndrome in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) was shown opposite the sole cis@@ pl@@ a @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms arms resulted from an improvement of the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control room .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ MU@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the survival effects on the overall survival was in favour of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ board epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6,@@ 2 versus 8.0 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study indicate that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for emet@@ ry x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T Pop@@ ulation and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adapted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) ; the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC Hist@@ ology to survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in the hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin were required less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the patients also needed the offering of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion and over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total capacity of 9@@ 1,8 ml / min and half @-@ time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who had received intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt @-@ inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ qui@@ al epithel@@ ial tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not in@@ effective , the retention periods and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has been conducted under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; solve the contents of the 100 mg @-@ pier@@ cing bottles with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
&quot; 23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials using P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the sample .
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and after 12 weeks do not register weight loss should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; when these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot reduce some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats fed with the food un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg , after one year an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ gang , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , passage o@@ ily sparkling wine ( flush ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ aria syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ im@@ al , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; All@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ted , it is necessary to adapt the dosage to elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Early treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures , in order to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a mar@@ ginal decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers received at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , as the absorption of consumed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
the incidence of known side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to any inhi@@ bitions concerning possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal studies , a rapid reg@@ ression of several systemic effects , which can be attributed to the anti@@ bacterial properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect rests in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper part of the small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials involving adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the starting value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist measurement was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 generally , in the case of therapeutic dos@@ ages , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , who administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ted dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form yl leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , begin before the first capsule intake with cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; food di@@ aries are effective , as you can easily compreh@@ end what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;

obesity affects your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; a lasting weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as speci@@ fying on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
take a look at the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is appropriate for you , please refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the effect of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutrition @-@ related symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Less physical activity &quot; means that you can burn only little or no stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sens@@ ory is a nutrition diary containing information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information material that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , to support weight loss , this information helps you to develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the drug prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong and moderate trig@@ gering for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with al@@ oh@@ x@@ i in 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with al@@ oh@@ x@@ i , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , versus 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ x@@ i ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the launch of Alo@@ x@@ i in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ x@@ i is indicated for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thickness of the col@@ on , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised by simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ x@@ i should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five examined chemotherapy agents ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) in pre@@ clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ o@@ eth@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ran@@ on@@ avi@@ r , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine ,
&quot; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron experience in human gest@@ ures does not occur , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies the most common adverse reactions were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ x@@ i , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relations to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cis@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given intra@@ ven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on Day 1 . &quot;
studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage is followed by an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average temporal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tion@@ ate in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total exposition of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to three consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the insertion of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites who have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine . Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; after a single intra@@ ven@@ ous membrane injection , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function distur@@ b the terminal elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 pre@@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ ic channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the period of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , end@@ oc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in Thy@@ roid gland , Hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , P@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al @-@ mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and since al@@ oh@@ x@@ i is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;
the owner of this permit for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recomm@@ ending the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided by the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ sustained ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , furthermore the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) have been elevated in the blood flow . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data covering the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment were set to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 e @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease re@@ acted to more patients than the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the study investig@@ ates the question to what extent the drug uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small in@@ fest@@ ed la@@ ins ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was sever@@ ed at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wound , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were considered by skin dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighing in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ filtration , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of retin@@ os@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogen ( see section 5.1 ) .
secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of retin@@ opathy and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on isolated skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo cannot be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on isolated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ opathy is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ opathy in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / completed is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery , which looked around 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differenti@@ ates itself from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , pull ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the application of retin@@ och@@ ulin at at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ opathy compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clusi@@ on to intact and on lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma bombs were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic on@@ set of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the M@@ ouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 isolated skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were observed . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two cans , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zing and ensuring that the vaccine plan can be brought to an end by two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children within a three @-@ dos@@ ed vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical contents , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix are also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix carried out one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals ( a permit for the transport of ambi@@ rix in the whole of Europe ) . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ination plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A antibodies ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injection vacc@@ ines , medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; for thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can come to bleeding after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection was administered at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , quad@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ ear@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ end@@ ants must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ iness , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al and preser@@ vatives @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 1,0@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and nu@@ dity on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the incidence of mat@@ iness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ iness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ inations that reported serious adverse events during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine using ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine using the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ I@@ SA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study from 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , one month after the complete vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the table below . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , quad@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ x vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ ed@@ ding by eyes on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC amended , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus infection even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your baby does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ ching r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the conven@@ tionally intended administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) . &quot;
&quot; in a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ goes .
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ gen your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated / or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( Anti@@ bodies ) have received / or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the insertion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • Appeti@@ te deficiency
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • Sw@@ elling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Rec@@ ommen@@ ds • ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
&quot; further side effects , which occurred days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include any limited or extended precip@@ itation , which can itch or be pale @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and the face , swelling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , loss of sensation or movement capacity of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; impot@@ ence of some blood vessels dis@@ comfort or feeling of illness , loss of appetite , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and abdominal pain , lymp@@ h node swelling increases tendency to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by drop of the amount of blood . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since obtaining the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambition remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix has only been marketed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with an in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ ac enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is distributed among several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , an ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , stomach pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the rar@@ eness of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was prescribed . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) an indication exists for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy exists in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated using protein toler@@ ances and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
&quot; after clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ us carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the development of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ .DLL contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ ol@@ lution . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at occurs over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ CT should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ CO is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms involve the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound generated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; for example , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate consumed for each gram can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with on@@ set of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was early almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death even when treated with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative paths of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first health month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ a@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ my carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; following an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ cl@@ ine disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average plasma gas concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no ration@@ ed effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ CO gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low pills , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; after clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ us carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ CO gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; for example , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral sol@@ itary dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ule form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ CO can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ .@@ As sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ .@@ As the medicine can pass into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , defic@@ its , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ .@@ Take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

31 • Tr@@ y a cleaned spo@@ on gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Cut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount of measuring spo@@ on of gran@@ ules is equivalent to a measuring spo@@ on . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest cage with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; st@@ inging &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is given and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to help maintain the flow of blood to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year after 30 days or one year . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ elevation in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional means of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; prior to surgery , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous cle@@ at of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the immediately subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tioned and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed prior to use and the dosage dose is quickly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT takes more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is properly administered . &quot;
a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , it is recommended to admini@@ ster a second dose of 0,3 mg / kg and re @-@ examine the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of stu@@ d . &quot;
&quot; included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ tension against the active ingredient or any other component or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or elevated blood pressure risk due to a disorder of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irre@@ versible bacterial end@@ oc@@ car@@ di@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial end@@ oc@@ car@@ di@@ tis .
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most of the bleeding of arter@@ ial points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can undergo bleeding in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira is achieved again prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia mechanism ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te Aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are inadequate in relation to the effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone . 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira and G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; both in the bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years suffered adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ira as in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the spot , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred at over 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years suffered adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira will immediately break down and the patient will monitor closely with regard to signs of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with ser@@ um of patients with which in the past had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases an additional bolt should be given from 0,@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ira and the inf@@ usion should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study an un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the three arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ gone within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ira were evaluated in patients under@@ going a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ira as pep@@ tide comes through a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from spl@@ itting the AR@@ G3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ ine .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active times than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin ; in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin can not be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving diabetes type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) , compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin patients . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.30 % in human @-@ insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra can possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a range of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra is applied either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous using continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may lead to a change in insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosing or abor@@ tion of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood @-@ related activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fluor@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ mers such as beta @-@ lo@@ osen , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin lu@@ c@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed in clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed according to system organs and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual experience creation or weakness , confusion , lack of vision , excessive dog , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated with intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person or treated by a physician through intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of glucose .
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ int ej@@ ection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin lu@@ li@@ sin takes place faster and the active time is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with Type 1 Diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus pointed out insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeutic dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a proportional @-@ proportional , glu@@ cos@@ es@@ izing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate rise of the glucose @-@ bearing effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ome effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with the human insulin insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was achieved 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is consumed 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin swal@@ low in administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
