<seg id="1">"this document is a summary of the European Public Authorization Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the treatment template (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Entering thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patients have several episodes (periods of anormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to take or the tablets to treat patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are also degraded as Abilify should be adjusted to Abilify dosage.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the transmission of signals between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but lower than the neurotransmitters to activate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the brain activity, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, who suffered increased restlessness over a period of two hours compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with semi-idol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared with the placebo reported by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in patients' symptoms were examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorted the enamel tablets and the solution to take up (absorbed).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased uneasiness than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurring of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal dysfunctions (continuous motion), tremors (drowsiness), irritation, nausea (sleepiness), irritation, nausea (sleepiness), irritation, restlessness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium to heavy manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes and outweigh the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the market launch of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardio-vascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting a year or less there were occasional reports on dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, treated with Abilify should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or cancel the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study involving a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related unwanted events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combative agents, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central acting drugs with itself overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify can be reckoned with a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in reproductive studies during pregnancy, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parsonism, acathisie, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled trial of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-vascular treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spigdyskinesia and varicose deaths, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose of use as Aripiprazol has a high plasmaprotein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine dopamine receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the administration of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Positron Emissions Tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a halopidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents responded to the study mediation in week 52, similar to Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asmin- Depressionrats Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">Placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the downfall rate at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) in an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole showed a compared to placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a compared versus placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium and Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium and Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not result in lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium and valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10. in a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol over 74 weeks before randomization, Aripiprazl was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in preventing a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxycycline of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyregulation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver cirrhosis of aripiprazol and dehydrotaripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductionist toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential the preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to the recommended maximum dose in humans) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle-steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"furthermore, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazl not more than 6% of concentrations found in the Galle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (in particular overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be used in addition to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted using metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with sulphonic acid or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl reside or insulin can be retained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulphonic acid or insulin."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphone resin, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg dosages."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphone resin in a reduction of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94% while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin received a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who received additional placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypogeal (decreased sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients who may respond hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="864">"actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c-Spiegels suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who might respond hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of actraphane need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package supplement)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initiale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar setting has significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA to insulin) can cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane, it may be necessary at the initial dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">"some patients in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"when travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions during the treatment and his patients always ask for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia which can occur in an uncontrolled diabetes therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can be gradually developed: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated through oral supply of glucose and sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"• Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven helper or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), have been deducted."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients who received an aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who deserted Desloratadine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, sleepiness, insomnia (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with disloratadine as monotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors like bromocripitin, pergolid, pergoid, pergoamine, cotoxine, oxymetazolin, Naphazolin etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosing.</seg>

<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"patients should however be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a lightheadedness, which may lead to an impairment of traffic airtightness, or the ability to operate machinery."</seg>

<seg id="2618">"the efficacy of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="2619">"as Palonosetron can extend the thickness of the colon, patients with anamnesty or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection."</seg>
<seg id="2620">"however, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised by simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension."</seg>
<seg id="2621">"in addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"in preclinical studies Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, dioxorubicin and mitomycin C) in preclinical studies."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"a clinical trial showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor."</seg>

<seg id="2625">"palonosetron experience in human gestures does not occur, therefore palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"in clinical studies the most common adverse reactions were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%)."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports."</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relations to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">"no dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an overdosage."</seg>
<seg id="2630">"in two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg Dolasetron (half-value 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-value 7,3 hours) received, which was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"in a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on Day 1."</seg>
<seg id="2632">Studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"according to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous dosage is followed by an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average temporal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionate in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">"from pharmacokinetic simulations, the total exposition of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to three consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the insertion of 0.75 mg higher."</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites who have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine. Palonosetron as an unmodified active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a single intravenous membrane injection, the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although patients with severe liver function disturb the terminal elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 preclinical trials suggest that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ionic channels that are involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarization and extend the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in Thyroid gland, Hypophysis, Pankreas, adrenal-marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"the underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and since alohxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is low for humans."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided by the Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference medicinal products" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-sustained) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damage, furthermore the values of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) have been elevated in the blood flow."</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data covering the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference doctor to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment were set to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been voiced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease reacted to more patients than the reference drug; Alpheon also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the study investigates the question to what extent the drug uses an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be applied for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infested lains (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was severed at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wound, altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were considered by skin dogs, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighing in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infiltration, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of retinosulin ointment, the treatment is broken off, the ointment carefully wipes out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of retinopathy and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on isolated skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not necessary if topical retinopathy is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinapamulin ointbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinopathy in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is preferable.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / completed is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the date of delivery, which looked around 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action retinapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differentiates itself from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransfer Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, pull romutiline inhibit the peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinochulin at at least some infection forms seem questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retinopathy compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily with occlusion to intact and on laced skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma bombs were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children aged 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic onset of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 was reduced to 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinopathy in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">"studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two cans, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunizing and ensuring that the vaccine plan can be brought to an end by two doses."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can fight against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine Twin Vaccine since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children within a three-dosed vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical contents, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix are also used as proof of the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month period and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix carried out one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix in a six-month and a 12 month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>

<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after priming."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"for thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, Ambirix cannot be injected subcutaneous, since it can come to bleeding after intramuscular administration."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active times than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin; in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where insulin can not be processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving diabetes type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7,46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7,46%), compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin patients."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra can possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a range of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra is applied either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta or subcutaneous using continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may lead to a change in insulin needs."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosing or abortion of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood-related activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, fluoroamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxylic, salicylate and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympatholymers such as beta-loosen, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent."</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by an appropriately trained person or treated by a physician through intravenous dosage of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucoagint ejection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin lulisin takes place faster and the active time is shorter than at hu- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with Type 1 Diabetes melli- tus pointed out insulin lulisin in the therapeutic dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg a proportional-proportional, glucosesizing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise of the glucose-bearing effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosesome effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data, a comparable postprandial glycemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with the human insulin insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
