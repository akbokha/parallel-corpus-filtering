&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the location of the entire page . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation , and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not make important decisions depending on the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish site itself , where you can directly add text to translation . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; load , select Settings Exten@@ sions ... Open the card @-@ card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that eventually more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; compile it before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash or the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module An@@ View Fil@@ ters ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allows to display the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tion@@ ate to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder is mirr@@ ored ; the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ emap file represents a rec@@ t@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful colour scheme and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched over to color mode , can either show depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les shall be used ( which is , therefore , the relative position of let@@ tering in the rec@@ t@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps rule should be comp@@ lied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always adher@@ ed . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ t@@ angle is quad@@ ratic . &quot;
&quot; as sharing the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is possible to divide the areas so that rectang@@ les are created that are as square as possible . the best methods concerning this are rows , columns or recur@@ rent branches . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu item View on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , developed for the use of C@@ ach@@ eg@@ ind . &quot;
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools Image Gallery ... or by Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the module gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
displaying the name of the picture in the picture to see if the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
displaying the thumb@@ nail file size of the picture to see if the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
the thumb@@ nail size indicates whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
in the file selection Save in HTML file specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a turn@@ table to which level the sub @-@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original pictures to the gallery and see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
you can use the commentary box in the commentary file to specify a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery .
you can specify a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures in the check box sel@@ ector color depth .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , how &amp; eg ; via camera or lens to search for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you are using these links , just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are talking about other users of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions about other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; visit home page to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam , participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the Developer Mail@@ ing List by &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can insert a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply type the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data log is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; will additionally be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ box set up collections
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; considers each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively expand the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folders . this can be done by ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported moun@@ ts in the Help tab support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h operations .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ ti@@ photo@@ 2 thumb@@ nails can be read reliably . Exif support is not used by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to view the thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; self @-@ carrying out . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images work everywhere : you can lay a picture in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , over the horizontal line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter works on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed . which fields can be shown you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings .
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; puts an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date the album was first created . the date can be changed in the features of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . just select Album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album features allowing you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used for sorting your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections from the toolbar , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
album Date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview quot ; choose . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be scra@@ ped .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have help window , which appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment on an image . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction section of the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all what it happened to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ed@@ ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the editing pane , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs when your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . therefore , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; presents two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; k@@ de ; delete , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image deletion or Del@@ f if you prefer really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers , the individual pictures or whole groups can be assigned . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags log@@ ically . you can also navigate parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also re @-@ import your tags in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click a new keyword , after you click on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and dro@@ pping it . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the Tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you selected with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can set a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window when you preview the image . &quot;
you can select a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photos with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all related images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the search box , a small lamp is the green when searching for hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if Search has nothing found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press the header OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just need to select the respective entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select a search edit , the search form will be displayed again with the search information entered before . if you select to edit as advanced search , the Advanced search dialog will appear . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select search in the context menu search . &quot;
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . each option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be added to this list using the search group / search group . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; each picture characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you slide a picture from anywhere on the icon of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : hands @-@ free color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; find the suitable pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini @-@ Program . you can zoom in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you preview preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or shift operations on one of the pictures , you can then compare the same area of both pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a picture series . if you use pairs to navigate from the toolbar , then the two first pictures will be automatically displayed in the left @-@ hand side . the right adjacent image will be displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal release actions also work directly out of the be@@ zel , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that allows you to recognize the visible area of the picture , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both pictures will display the same image area . &quot;
zoom buttons below the images or Ctr@@ l ; Zoom to zoom into the image and zoom in . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
&quot; each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to backup your images , find , protect , and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , storing , saving , waiting and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ ection@@ ates and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even need to know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use and digi@@ ti@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos will have to store them on a dedicated drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you want to print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option stored in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to enable it . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? added to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes available . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keyword passwords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ l@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the words - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos just with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure to get interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; W@@ ow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the meaning to transmit to Him about the motive you &apos;ve moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; you can export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your pictures into web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your request in the label and / or title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time . &quot;
&quot; do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation already drives with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . this will also export k@@ ml files you can export with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for authors and writers ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for link bar ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can use this to delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : disk error , panel failure , power sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same , which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality which are more expensive and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . so the best DVD recor@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; you use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ms . in spite of this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then stored on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disc@@ othe@@ que &quot;
&quot; soon : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature ranges , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors are the most common error cause . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors are the most frequent cause of failure . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s most anticipated life@@ times are between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not account a lot , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage to your computer . these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage to your computer . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and avo@@ ids the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed especially for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to even continue to work until the current runs . if you purchase an US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high quality over@@ voltage protection can you get up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , a 500@@ W US@@ V you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember to tr@@ ench all cables before you go to vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are home however very expensive compared to hard disks - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ issions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and B@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have a photo in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms to use Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most memory . it leads to a lower damage than such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has long been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the examination process during a sudden stop during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hits you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference securing : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete f@@ use and the last differential backup .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception , which is only ast@@ o@@ unded and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copied the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is happening and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
secure important images after saving them to your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional th@@ inning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable on account of your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate yourself as time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to expand on a dedicated disk or partition .
&quot; use the d@@ mes@@ g command to check if your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not attach it . &quot;
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ db ; pres@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of drive if needed
&quot; open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no longer any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . so you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open source format designed by Adobe Systems . DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ ited to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some time .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to this because it stores metadata separately from the image file , but it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I belong to the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera image , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; you can use external programs for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered editing process . if you edit the images again with digi@@ ti@@ zer ; then you should add the metadata again . these were , under certain circumstances , cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the Ad@@ ding of a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras display no thumb@@ nails at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras display no thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can view the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted , and we recommend checking if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , you can download the download and then download Sel@@ ected button . download the selected button until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not yet been released by &amp; digi@@ kam , downloaded . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the buttons to download or download Sel@@ ected Objects , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder , and then select the Album list in the section My Albums tab . then , select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ pack ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete all . if you want to delete only some , you must first select it and use Del@@ ete Del@@ ete Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to reset the photos you have deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this about the camera status , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ used once the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you have photos of different recording galleries in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ verbs . if you use this latter option , a folder is created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d : % M : % M : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the option Camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , which &amp; digi@@ kam , used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ be ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; all images with the same date will be uploaded to the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date will be uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar Met@@ a data , you can read about which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually turned off , and in that case , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the option data @-@ based sub @-@ bombs at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the picture selection is done , inter@@ viewing and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot later where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to document the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ing and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ ps@@ api.dll or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical allocation . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script working with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; editing dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on Embedded preview or start editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main screen .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s title : this field should include the professional designation of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author if he is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be listed here since this is the picture other &amp; quot ; &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and is not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ This metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the descriptions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; folder folder that has none of these extensions is by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
default settings can be reset again by pressing the Up@@ gra@@ ding button on the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the full screen size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant to be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm is loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ loss setup , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . if you use this option , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images in four steps will get more details in the pointed lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter , i.e. the parts of your pictures that are burned @-@ in , as a continuous white look at . use the setting of transparent white in the settings . the setting color dis@@ solve creates some unusual results , since it shows the pointed @-@ lights in various rais@@ ins . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial ro@@ ster data that many cameras have and a matrix color pixel available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ es @-@ Direc@@ ted ) created the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w , but it generates color art@@ e@@ facts on edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening procedure since it is performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
questions when an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files start .
&quot; colour Profile folder Sets here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c where you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b@@ . or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the mapping by yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print picture as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not for Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; and these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Options short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the cap@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check@@ boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Identi@@ fication that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have an USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera selected from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any denom@@ ination for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the del@@ eting of a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions , otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate display screen ; at startup , this speeds up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , it asks if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry / editing option .
&quot; the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in and digi@@ ti@@ zed , so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or Save the Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly make a copy of your picture before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the File menu or using the button The button re@@ connect the image processing to restore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last storage . &quot;
virtually any image editing action can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can undo by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Del@@ ete from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should change the short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the Return or Rec@@ over button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or use the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : &quot;
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select Print Print from the File menu and get the default &amp; code ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . complete picture preview pages can be printed out of your choice . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export job coach . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also available in the image editing pane . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear resp@@ . return to the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should observe these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ lic@@ ant button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to one image . to rate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in an IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ et ; session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword . you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the respective check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main screen . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Other .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rules section . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry for which is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set a Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button to use . the options look as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .

&quot; the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject is based on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color wat@@ ery ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ mer your monitor because s@@ RGB goes out that your monitor is on s@@ RGB . when you use s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the features norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast expand from the menu Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection trying to automatically make your colors the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity across the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its colour shade . this feature is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; similar : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ aire factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic synchron@@ ization : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ ti@@ sing of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because a color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correc@@ ting will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness immediately , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ancy of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; right up a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjusting lets you improve the shadows of your photos or even dim them . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and re@@ charge it later .
the Pre@@ ferences knob re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
&quot; here you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of shell images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in chapter Col@@ oring Management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for multiple photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for tone @-@ value correction , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under paints gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the display has four color effects , a solar panel effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the colour , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the extra light . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the extra light . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally produces a negative image that is not to be created on photo paper . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it em@@ bel@@ lish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you do a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ al@@ correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you will need only the area of the slider . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use is to shift the controller and watch out how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three regulator : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color p@@ encils can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to alter the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create an easy image as background while something else is in the foreground .
&quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and then loaded again . to this end , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and Sonn@@ ent@@ öne . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide bar . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant Channel . shadow and Sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image editing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you are also using the option Mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color space . &quot;
the Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) rotary filter .
Gel filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle tones while adding a bit of cold in the shades . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ iat@@ ae . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; applying mould texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of magni@@ fied points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the Relief relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; tool box can add a decorative frame to add an image .
&quot; keeping the eye of a viewer into the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , insert the chosen frame type for your image . permanently , the image completes with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce transforms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a button effect and decorative trim a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with frames will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any position . this can also be done at several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; tool sten@@ cil you can put a template over an image .
the menu sten@@ cil template can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over an image .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template file size , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder in the dialog with the Base Fol@@ der button . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will update the templates of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below to the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; presents three different tools for sharp@@ ening , each one of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it doesn &apos;t shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need correction of sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus combined to form a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; with JPEG images , a camera is often used internal sharp@@ ening . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get the control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can call up the section called Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; but they should be careful with this , as the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ening increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique is re@@ focuss@@ ing the tool . under re@@ focusing , you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ening . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharp@@ ening . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image a little bit sof@@ tly and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
bl@@ ur@@ ry the filter is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first try out the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will create close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught picture one that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid f@@ laws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade was applied with radius = 6.0 , A@@ mount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used this copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it re@@ focus the de@@ focuss@@ ing . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Filter@@ ing . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus will usually start better results than bl@@ ur@@ red .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the auss &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the sources that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . &quot;
&quot; gauge &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your vag@@ ue gauge is wrong . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase of the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select big values for the round@@ ness or the gauge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes which are not immediately visible , but leave later unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , click on it ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ ring a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear filter . the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is often as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image needs to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field of sharp@@ ening in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator smooth@@ es the vag@@ u@@ eness of the area of the dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the ink ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the rider &apos;s smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; attention to detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture . if greater values are mainly homo@@ geneous region smoothing and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should ensure that no field of sharp@@ ening should be subordin@@ ated to the directional dependen@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; direction of direction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dation or CCD no@@ ises will generate a high value wav@@ y patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , adjust this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm will go through . normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle step@@ wise since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only minimal . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . to correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded later .
&quot; correction errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ e@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings dialog can remain with default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ink the image .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the depth of field . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine light density changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more rough@@ ened , but also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other if it is too high . &quot;
&quot; save and load : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the file system and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ e@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ e@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the texture composition is performed by a different tool , the image error correction , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a lossy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that can be seen in an un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with similar noise can be reduced . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si &apos;s camera was taken on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures reduced to an old color photo , which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that were caused by scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ pack ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows hot@@ pixels of photos that were taken with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ room to the picture to be corrected . an automatic process of the dark will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and automatically re@@ charges it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixel in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixel in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo formats , can often not light up the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; but it also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the lens filter , which increases the necessary closing time under certain circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filters and color or grey scale depths of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ Filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light gain at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of compens@@ ating a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree to compens@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more fine adjustment of exposure to the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu Color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous correction and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion .
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger in the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &quot; &quot; corners &quot; &quot; has the opposite sign of the parameter in general . &quot;
zoom : this value scales the image size and thus performs a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image dimin@@ ishes .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will display the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ing or over@@ lap correction should be done before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . if you cut a picture an@@ ew and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious to Fal@@ sche . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a ver@@ m@@ kis@@ sing distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the &quot; &quot; Transformation &quot; &quot; from the image processing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most images , the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs , such as photos from the front , frame and painting , is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option F@@ ogging film gran@@ ulate when you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filters mix color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind au@@ ra in the pointed lights .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix great silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gran@@ ular view specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was marked in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; filter En@@ tran@@ ce is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ sty landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture here is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ sharp effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Infin@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels by a central point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rot@@ ational camera .
distance bl@@ ur@@ red : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to res@@ ign in the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening Un@@ ity : bl@@ urs the image soft into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ greetings : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through random displacement of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ry : finds the ink in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
&quot; some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
&quot; you can select with the filter ; image editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ p filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you restore or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose Transform@@ ate Size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many photo editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
the Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each image can be enlarged as text file and then loaded later .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can stop the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by magni@@ fying a small color image on double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard Aug@@ mentation for comparison .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create an image . in order to cut a photo you simply have to use the mouse with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and width is assigned to width . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; cutting the tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the integration assistance settings allow you to f@@ ade help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden mean is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put an image together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographer . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise . &quot;
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to hold the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image editing and tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it by pressing the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have shot an image you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Transform@@ ate trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cro@@ pping feature . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the turn . but keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re @-@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you will get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to trim the image with converting trimm@@ ing from image processing . &quot;
&quot; the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can move horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is wi@@ ped a little . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two shades produce twice as much dou@@ bl@@ eness and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with trans@@ verse cli@@ pping from image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , it will display the file in the editing pane . in the configuration section you can find more information about this . &quot;
&quot; almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam , supports both formats . &quot;
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way in this way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour highly helpful instructions in English . you can convert crude format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you will find more information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; supports loading of rough pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats that came from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supported :
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam , you can preview or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start the program to play . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
vertically split without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertically split . the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divided . the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini @-@ Program . you can zoom in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot Custom color and Set used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the palette , you can select from a list of the installed pallets , or browse the folders by files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse over the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is chosen over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the over@@ write check@@ box under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; graph@@ ene is used in science , especially in computer science . graph@@ ene is used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph ; in one &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required are :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ rup@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list lets open the open files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum com@@ min@@ ution of a graph .
&quot; if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ diagram ; loaded file was changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but you can change it afterwards with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ ene that are on a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;

&quot; the Renew@@ t Download page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( opening or not opening the files of the last session or not ) or deciding to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ executed graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ board model for non @-@ executed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ end@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should be able to accept the graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as parameters , and specify the comp@@ uted layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can change the graph with specific options , or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ alizing images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ api.dll can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and run the menu . the above looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time , so the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation below is below , the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same site . since the dialog takes the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Leading it over and over again until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab@@ s selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is mostly self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . push Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Close to Close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a wind@@ owed mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store images in JPEG format below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool so you can connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. notice : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please see ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ mati@@ cs and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a basic screen@@ shot . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that you can use Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is set below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set using the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your needs , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ dec or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ s and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the Settings button at the bottom right . &quot;
the Print Ass@@ ist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to process your pictures frequently or later continue using it , you should not choose the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality is deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; the batch mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format . &quot;
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; once you have started the module , the picture window with the images you have selected will be displayed . you can add more images using a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
clicking the Images button will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are already attached as attachment .
don &apos;t mind too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures will be put together in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ ants are added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so you can view the status messages , search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the Close button , you can close this window . &quot;
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like your slideshow appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a suitable graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
displaying the file name option ensures that the fil@@ ename of the images will be shown in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option to select images acci@@ dentally ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the pictures , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . so , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends presentation ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . at random each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
&quot; during slideshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the lower left of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. notice : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have completed your pictures and videos with notes , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , there are now in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keywords entries present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the entry button with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your impact zone . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images in addition to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable image for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . in the context menu you can select the image for each person . in the context menu you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you call the Search Site in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the Help menu item w@@ photo@@ album ; - demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample images will be loaded and you can test the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in preview screen ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create html web pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages you will need to set up some settings . these are divided into three areas , content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
first enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you can find more information about export files in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer is obvious . for example , that all images are shown by a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images , so those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download any pictures , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have fixed . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best of all , select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder in which all of your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added for all future images . here , you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start . the URL you set here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings for setting up all three are related to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing images . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures that you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file when the manual is located near the .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal ZIP files . since most pictures were compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories they correspond to your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can synchron@@ ize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse pictures and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups and m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) setting up the information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of its pictures . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CVS repository , where you want it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used them automatically in future starts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings options are explained .
&quot; to the left you can see six different icons , with which you can preview the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described to you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . more information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always use the demo database using the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications using the modules above K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications use their images in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order by albums for some modules so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
beside the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category people , you will do so , so if you have selected people to view and share this with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , etc . , for example , you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures . if , for example , pictures are pic@@ tured on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for browsing and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can view three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : if you have for example a family celebration and are represented on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can so that the used names are moved up , the persons can find and assign them more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can make it more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window representing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category in the Con@@ text menu . in addition , you can also drag and drop an entry to a category of this entry . note that this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you are sorting your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area .
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window , among other things . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window display again later , use the Options ... and then open a / f@@ ade window . this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have no filter . an example for this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply pointing down@@ wards dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it is displayed in the image viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the images you want to delete and click either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use images anywhere without you stored on the disk . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; so , as you see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance about how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those left you want to make accessible to others and click on Lat@@ est View in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your little sister to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; please note that this photo protection is by no means very secure . for one , all images on the hard drive and on the other can be read out or er@@ ase the password as an un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only useful for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to ad@@ vert the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; why you want to describe all your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it &apos;s natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . it of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and below . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow ; and then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full@@ screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
&quot; if you are using the viewer , you can zoom in and out . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in again . the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation key set the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work in videos will work in and out with the plus and zero key .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view it and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . but you may prefer to just select the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poor@@ ly as you view one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to equi@@ p images with characteristics while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; this is described in . if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you selected , you just have to use one module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in special preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you are allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the ch@@ amo@@ is is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch off the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select On the Pain@@ ting from the contex@@ tual menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the menu Insert . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click App@@ ly , or reject the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can use the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the texture selected , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected , or the Vis@@ i@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level chosen in the toolbar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple window assignments and simply switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left in the terminal strip . &quot;
to close a view click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent the closing click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
the current window view allows you to save with view window arrangement ... store it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon to ren@@ ame the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode matches entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di from the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image area for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling takes the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively as the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam each pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by following a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be followed individually and examined for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted to the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the related rays don &apos;t hit an object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray image , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendering . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here you will find the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. al@@ timeter data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in various paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features .
&quot; you can set the object code of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projection . &quot;
&quot; when displaying a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window assignments or create new window assignments . in the window an@@ ings section , explains how to create and store window assignments . &quot;
the Combin@@ ation field Standard Window System : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window assignments shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name indicates all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card screen view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow any steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
if you have installed everything wrong you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . you now have a scene without objects .
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation zu &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert final body qui@@ ver ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands as far as the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment will then change in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment shows only a matte black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment . so please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the simpl@@ est now . &quot;
&quot; if you see no color on the header and sphere in preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then preview the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you click on the icon with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to execute this step , because you should have the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : click 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball ho@@ ver over the ground . otherwise , the ball would move over the ground . &quot;
&quot; of course rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , place an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to her . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; first select sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on the sphere of Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ yl@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , ren@@ derer &apos;s hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays shoot from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit undo .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ dict rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes , which can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; sk@@ ate show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; sk@@ ate show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or if all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog direc@@ ting - &amp; sk@@ ate show ; there are five cards . in three of these , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; sk@@ ate show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ate show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; sk@@ ate show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can create &amp; sk@@ ate show ; so set up that only some of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card @-@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; sk@@ ate show ; will also be closed , if no browser window is open . &quot;
view the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings you need to set up in the Settings show@@ photo ; set up between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color chosen when the under@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . the same page can also be found in the image editing pane . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; skan@@ je ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes as pictures to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ els ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than pictures to scan and save .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; skan@@ je ; with the command output -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; in order to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and dra@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; skan@@ je ; to save images . dialog for storing for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image opens , then you need to choose them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... Change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the image to be stored automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is stored each time a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; skan@@ je ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; skan@@ je ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of this short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking the player window and set short commands ... Select .
you may set existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , which can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from Collection , Con@@ text Browser , Player , Play@@ list , Play@@ lists Browser and Scrip@@ ts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can share data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which every K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to execute . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure script to display the Setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change Sign@@ aling that a new piece is applied . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the gener@@ ational amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script pack@@ ets right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can load it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link to the Wik@@ i script site of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has lots of useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus .
&quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the choice is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music new ! &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications there are some options to enable or disable compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enabled debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; make an atmospheric shape : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , thereby changing the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; store mood files in music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist when saving , save the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece changes , make sure that the play@@ lists pop up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ red . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can customize and Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can set the usage of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using proprietary fonts , the otherwise gray section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have even the choice of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; set up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors are not enabled , the default colors are used ; colors are used . &quot;
the Display text input box displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the cartridge card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to super@@ vise the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; any play@@ lists found in your collections folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , then appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Combin@@ ation Field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is necessary in the my@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under machine : enter the computer where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that is entered in port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name for which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card load .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
transmit played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performers are called : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the each played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only requires the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instruction on how to minim@@ ally compile k@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the times , this is due to the fact that Tag@@ lib will crashes when reading the Met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
&quot; make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. , e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing Met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the Met@@ a information , but not tagged as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ play / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only make a mistake there , if you find something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From the playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to the add button , the button can be saved . click it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ bit with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you want a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you want a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with highest priority priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the Sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less lin@@ ings react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . carry out the logging regi@@ sters to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; then try to start this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute G@@ Stre@@ amer delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name also contains the magical K ... : ) &quot;
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running unit : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows are separated . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size that can be changed .
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the Control Panel icon ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece itself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then select the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : comment Select or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE pack@@ ets have a fixed release plan that cannot be merged with Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon when playing in the General settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select settings toolbar ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click Create New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
audio @-@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information that plays on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio @-@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you have to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
&quot; I get the error is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module also has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; under Settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with one on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ mod@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick in the sound@@ card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not going to be taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tain@@ er for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will be set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it immediately with the help of the button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the Burn menu . you have here different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the current play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area will change the playing time , the remaining play time of the play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , even under the text@@ line display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; under the scroll display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ Q . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to start the play position or adjust the volume . with the Play buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the check box E@@ Q , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions be scar@@ ed , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted by context browser themes . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ts . these three sub@@ windows are later added to the detail . &quot;
&quot; if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the statistical window can be collected ( Tools statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the just running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images may have any names but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended tracks , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information in the music sub@@ window should be displayed . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the pop @-@ up menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the separate areas to start playing instantly . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . if you don &apos;t have a text script , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is needed .
the Search button opens a search for google.com based on the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Performer - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left aside . &quot;
&quot; group Performer / Album - First , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further parti@@ tioning after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Performer / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are sorted first by genre and among them by artist .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - this setting works exactly the same way as the above , but additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change your collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select various time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can of course select your total collection , which makes the filter practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ aps the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on any entry will have the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; to transfer Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e for transmission to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Due to this , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
mark - Select the selected album as a compilation and it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
&quot; the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the accompanying interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( such as iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you need to find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter , sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the songs you want from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar contains a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a entered URL . for example , if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , attachments can be difficult by simple dro@@ pping . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , dropped files can be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist en@@ closes all items attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply using the mouse to the desired location . if you enter letters there , only the pieces will be displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces , search keywords , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing blan@@ ks , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants with each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not the comment bad .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctr@@ l key , and pressing the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the kno@@ bs undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you can see in the player window through the right mouse button . via this menu , you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many other buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also disable the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu , you can reach &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s settings . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visualization plug @-@ in . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions Cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your big savings in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played at first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in queu@@ e administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details of setting up these will follow later ) . &quot;
fill in your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m &apos;s recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ anning bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want to play , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . &quot;
&quot; the suggested tracks start with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece of your collection . the recommended tracks will be added at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic Mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then you open the dialog to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while respecting the setting of play@@ able pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces stored at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok scripts by installing on script . a new entry will be opened in which a script package will be opened to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also get new scripts directly from the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visualization plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other lossy compression formats , remember that when you re @-@ code to MP3 you get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether an audio CD has been created by a lossy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . wait until the computer completes the burning process .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this or something like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the input of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be fired . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all types of CD R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has all functions that are also automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned Audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . such programs are generally known as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 Enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to dec@@ ryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . en.@@ de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums may lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently lou@@ dly . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ ename . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
&quot; when a project has changed and hasn &apos;t been saved , queries &amp; k@@ 3@@ b asks for what to happen . you can then choose between stores and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ saved project to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file Sch@@ illing . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every project that is not stored , it will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file Sch@@ illing . &quot;
&quot; when you go to this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described about the What is the ? help ( reachable by right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project .
this feature only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; the CD Copy dialog opens . it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ ing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as nos g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the bor@@ row@@ ed video , encoding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the recorded medium . this information is presented in the table of contents and includes features of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
enables viewing and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
&quot; the header is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key bind@@ ings for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , when you start the wizard , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to fine @-@ tune the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is equipped like many other &amp; k@@ de applications , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , through a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more likely to offer your taste and the type of task you need . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line utility . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then type something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Re@@ quests cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Re@@ quests bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project on the command line using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String String ) void del@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void del@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Type Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Ex@@ cer@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on Enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these WAV files ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter &quot; &quot; Which Ko@@ di@@ ers &quot; &quot; is a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as I said earlier , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to use a protected audio CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avo@@ ids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the copy protection mechanisms . just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the Setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling to read a &amp; CD ; will be explained on the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , all manually collected . &quot;
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the set @-@ up of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - when a enco@@ der is configured in the enco@@ der settings in the setup folder - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the standard . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the Setup Settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as minutes , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various card expansion cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most frequent . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people , and most of the music &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . any information can anyway be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which reading program is used to store songs from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know it more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the bor@@ row@@ ed WAV files , the enco@@ der and hence the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the enco@@ der tab . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab itself . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ effici@@ ents . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can receive more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you should have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that will probably be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each recording &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der used to comp@@ ress the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it on every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card General settings . here is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only for incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , begins immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection box and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , if you are using fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , you have to select the two selection boxes , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you .
&quot; both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ck@@ down the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want any &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activ@@ ating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously dis@@ appearing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process can be ej@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; just enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ ashed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously coding WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a .@@ wa@@ v file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will build MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard drive is organized , has been described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each recording &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example to find . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , look in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will pop up , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually navigate this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , unless you have a syn@@ op@@ sis with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for each of the comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( for example if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restri@@ cts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on just 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you will have a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files . with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats .
just select an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the suff@@ ix CD ; in this example it is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the items for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the play list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or click the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the selected button select the reading process started , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider &apos;s orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a co@@ dec which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code in parallel . keep in mind the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any indication of how to proceed from this sort of empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you want to add something useful , may it do . at least after contacting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time control of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the keys pressed on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; cl@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window onto K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ esses or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the slider . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the tempo LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry Pause in the Move menu . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music . some pieces use text property , others use lyrics property and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that a song is used so that you don &apos;t need to manually set the Kara@@ oke Text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a type of event , select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played after the series . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning of the same songs as the original ones .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . consider that if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , when a piece is opened , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the pieces opened . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop@@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; in order to jump back a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map includes General MIDI Events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary replac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , it is essential that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; A further key map ... &quot; EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how to see the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ als is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all notes that this instrument needs to put on tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; in which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the tone signi@@ fies the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess it ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how notes are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is its presence . you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , simply make it in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will always be used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option may be useful in order to always use the P@@ erk@@ eling patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is given in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is intended to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the View channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs some 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a distribution distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; work surface a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch off Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Madrid . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a little time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and prove pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an enlargement of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and I don &apos;t get any money from anybody . I would like to stress that I only continue to chat because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Die@@ fen@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , error noti@@ fications or just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course my thanks to all of these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because sound quality depends considerably on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ RE@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error noti@@ fications directly to me . &quot;
&quot; and K@@ MP@@ layer ; is a simple interface for MP@@ layer , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to playback video files from MP@@ layer or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s , or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you add an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked record . &quot;
&quot; the various files in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select the Play@@ list from the Create Play@@ list menu and select either the Edit Mode , or choose another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can be turned on only by changing XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically stopped by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of one favorite photos : &amp; lt ; ; &amp; lt ; int@@ f ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / &amp; lt ; / &amp; lt ; / ; &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here you can set the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of the MP@@ layer . here , the output of m@@ player is visible . &quot;
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash can be played with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages you have to specify the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module as service provider for the application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is in a console application to start and search for error messages regarding the loading of the Browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the contex@@ tual menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play cards from TV , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the MP@@ layer , the dialog is in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be known ports to be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , different names are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is the user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts slowly but why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a comp@@ iling of &amp; K@@ ile ; needed .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely used for the package &amp; tex@@ live ; res@@ p &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components may be included in the Linux distribution ; for installation , documentation of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the K@@ ile ; website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or compile &amp; check , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; latex ; work surface . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility of using all &amp; latex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be consul@@ ted at K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for and latex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ y can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good cover to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . um &amp; latex ; should be good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick entry wizard by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , film &#91; sample &#93; , or custom . &quot;
encoding : this is set to set the encoding . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for and latex ; for integration they will only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users have no need to worry . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; it offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; with automatic execution of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective icon . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful whenever a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding row in &amp; latex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the original output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when searching for a part in the DVI ; file , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected with the editor and once an element has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the pre@@ text search is the exact opposite of it . the pre@@ text search is the exact opposite of it . the pre@@ text search is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; latex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is listed on the &quot; &quot; turn@@ table &quot; , &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick assembly . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool bar , the three large selection fields should be identified . the selection fields have been developed for fast entry of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the drop down sel@@ ector is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , joints or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or otherwise element is created . &quot;
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( choice about a selection box possible ) .
&quot; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and , the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e &quot; &quot; is used to set the font size . you can set the font size for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot;
2 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with the hand .
&quot; the brackets under the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also occur in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source text has to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ r building or the quick assembly . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically initi@@ ates storage .
&quot; fail to comp@@ iling the document , should be searched for errors in logging . when using rapid build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , also the logging should be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the written 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { exposure } and ends with \ \ end { percentage } .
&quot; after the background is presented to write the source text with &amp; latex ; now , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the preparation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile follows . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a device independent file format ( English e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as needed for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the kno@@ bs in the toolbar . &quot;
the default search allows direct jump from editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . to do this simply Modern under Settings can set up ... tools build .
&quot; in order to perform the desired search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on pre@@ text search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is then eff@@ ected . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this you have to set up &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if a mistake is available when using the fast @-@ assembling of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , an error may exist . if there is a mistake , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file declares the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the text@@ files may then be used by La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors . the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jump to the incorrect line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used for the fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by changing an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are sub@@ stituted by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings K@@ ile ... Settings can be set in General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the resulting commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way the following steps have to be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default one . &quot;
template can be created from any &amp; latex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one in the Internet and searched through the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the Tools directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options , the hand@@ book should be consul@@ ted at K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; usage as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word meaning that in this way the \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can add additional mark@@ ers . this is a special type of bookmark within the text . the menu entries , or the respective keyboard short@@ cuts reach the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also applies to this jump stamp , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent features , in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands to select text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of source code . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; latex ; -@@ pack@@ ets with a back @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for the end of a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the Description to Edit paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore &amp; K@@ ile ; for more orders under Edit Environment for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the surrounding area .
&quot; if the cursor is present before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , it will be spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly lose the above overview . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be broken . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment .
with this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sealed clasp .
&quot; when the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many ne@@ sted braces groups brackets can be quickly lost to the above . this command closes the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not dis@@ assembled . &quot;
&quot; for the purpose @-@ giving implementation , the sign is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; used for two simple reference marks . also for the ending of the application , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and includes two closing marks for and latex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set in Set K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X Add and exit .
&quot; you can also use custom settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and therefore German or French quotation marks . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when you press Shift ; Enter key for &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not just a new@@ line break , but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , &amp; K@@ ile included ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables @-@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other . while pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for and latex ; ) it has been added for a variety of modes . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under settings K@@ ile ... fully adjustable . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and thus spo@@ ols the mailing list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , by &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump marks can be set , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can then be flow@@ n . &quot;
&quot; under Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . there may be various wa@@ iter lists for &amp; tex , - and &amp; latex ; orders as well as expand@@ ings of general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . it will always have a few characters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the call to complete protection will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for the complete termination of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full@@ filled environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically flow@@ n and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient res@@ ign@@ ation can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and can be terminated by pressing the button key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is flow@@ n . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the root @-@ list of termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ instructions .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; Sup@@ ports custom lists of cancell@@ ations that are immediately replaced with longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l is used , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated over the menu processing or pressing Ctr@@ l + Alt + Alt , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ ags in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; K@@ ile ; the complete termination for all already written notes . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be deter@@ red . here , the threshold for the display of the contract can be determined . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Graphics dialog box shapes the input of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating changes and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion , the keyboard short@@ ages Alt ; 2 can be used . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 using alt ; 4 using alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the fast @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; and latex ; is a rather balanced system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and an additional &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; as it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all files to &amp; K@@ ile ; delivered documents and a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or fac@@ ebook words . by &amp; K@@ ile , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the spac@@ ebar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ier and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work space environment . &amp; C@@ ile ; is also a part of the Fink project which makes &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; can also be executed on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
&quot; many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license . current information about the contribut@@ ors can be found in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber &amp; K@@ ile ; &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for emails . the sig@@ natures edit random sig@@ natures or sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . due to many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature from the sig@@ natures file is read by &amp; k@@ sig . for each day , you use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N file New . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you like . then , you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there is always enough sig@@ natures . &quot;

&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows opinion pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we add it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ war@@ med working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time you have pro@@ c .
&quot; as I said before , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently open index@@ .@@ doc@@ book file is opened , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be scann@@ ed is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then they release the current file easily . if not , they delete the file at the current file and select the file to be scann@@ ed by another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed review option . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , they select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition as well as for the Relax@@ NG validation is the definition of the Defin@@ itions @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit instantly and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can use the plug @-@ in in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . you can find more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the contained plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often on a project , several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project like both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the button as supp@@ ressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be drawn up to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will add a file to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the site Event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following things :
notes to enter is simple . either the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; note can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project manager By field and sub@@ project leaders , the respective areas or sub@@ project leaders should be given as shown in the examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that are agnos@@ tic and supported web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Set@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that will be treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : large / lo@@ wer@@ case by tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , it is optional for tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; starting and closing day automatic update : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into the corresponding code during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . the standard rendering can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with File Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is excluded from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source text at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings back to the default when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section provides the control of the possibility to switch the display of war@@ nings by hooks out of no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree using the mouse buttons . &quot;
empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; Just @-@ Read &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ read @-@ only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then Test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations via plugins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available that adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all the stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will connect to the debu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it is not necessary to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the debu@@ gger view .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this occurs while the script is stopped , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if this occurs while a script is stopped , execution starts as soon as a request is asked . &quot;
the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes any In@@ cludes .
&quot; the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and includes . &quot;
&quot; as@@ signs the debu@@ gger to pass the directive and go to the next , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can input a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help you better .
&quot; type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility make out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool files . tag folder contain two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . toolbar icons are handy , symbol @-@ oriented p@@ ests of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day displays . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a typ@@ ing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folder is nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users will have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is illustrated in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that is group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
&quot; speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag to define . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed properly .
&quot; spaces don &apos;t affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is pop@@ up at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; currently , this function is currently not available . currently , the check occurs only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
in the following one example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example of a functioning family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ lade function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD . editing an &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the Custom button can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on this it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , you try to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default input . in the selection box , input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , in case the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; , &quot; if available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol , we replace it before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly regarded as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ Tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview .
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please customize their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ Language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll leave the first part to you , the second we handle here . &quot;
&quot; mode 1 = func@@ 1 , func@@ 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible portion of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent on the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resource files .
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used for creating context @-@ sensitive help . by marking the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; you are not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else who are sent . at different places there is a menu entry like D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email to send tool items toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . we recommend that the resources be checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the future users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload toolbar items , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource is warning and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Load and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / en http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first deal with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars about actions , all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ gli@@ des the common use of special tools and patterns within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construc@@ tional views , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as close the current document , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area lead to another contex@@ tual menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as the basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cursor den@@ otes a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the editors of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; if you want to insert a tag that represents multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate and navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the display with tab@@ s are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or deletion of files from the storage media can be performed with the pop@@ up menu pop@@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates can only be used in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in global , local and project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands is displayed in relation to the navigation and refresh of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree @-@ views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the application system aligned to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the source for documentation ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boards at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the startup of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
&quot; the toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and are not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able Mark@@ up Language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above mentioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or w@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta running ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converts special characters into &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day . &quot;
turn on or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script returns error messages !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that is the window in which you can view the display of script functions and debu@@ gger .
trig@@ gering and turning of the problem report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
load a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... to be added . toolbar items are saved by toolbar items , or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the field of view . that does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the toolbar will be present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment . &quot;
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where any other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description file .
&quot; loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded into the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent past@@ ing of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking a activated plug @-@ in is disabled . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ heb@@ ungs@@ schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external use ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching can sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influence any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar , or add them and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate help in the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project , developers can always use assistance . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information panels can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here the name for the project is to be entered , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file will be filled out automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le.com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar items are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if you have server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of good th@@ inner .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the debu@@ gger . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ in can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles high loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing a custom profile view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , one can turn event actions and add or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the Project File menu or the Project File Open from the toolbar . the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; modified files will happen . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves similarly , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right mouse button call@@ able context menu : &quot;
here you can search for different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten with the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option is not in question .
&quot; this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before upload . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
&quot; depending on your spru@@ e shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there can be many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best available through the Tools menu . use and addition differ . adding toolbar buttons is treated below in the Add dialog toolbar . &quot;
&quot; toolbar buttons and symbols can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , which can be created using New Action , Ren@@ ame a New toolbar , which leads to the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visu@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will also remove the action and edit action which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbar ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically folder skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ escal@@ opes and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like an ordinary file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary Tem@@ plates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in the Template Tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally more specific documents are written in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on templates .
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As templates save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . see the Template Tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Template save Selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping or inser@@ ting over the con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or project file tree view , you can click on a folder to the right and create Site template . by default it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can specify head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
templates structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template menu with right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a drop down box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led whenever mis@@ erable attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder would be set , it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a contex@@ tual menu ( pointing to right mouse button press ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - and when needed to switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ot of &amp; PHP ; to edit it , it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in syn@@ ch@@ ron . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , the key will move the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is set to set up via settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword keyword 2 in the contents column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the page in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is possible as with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor acts as usual in a text editor , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by button or distance paste . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other dro@@ pping anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the list assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , you need other libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ ename with no path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example loaded a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l the following entry is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a pre@@ diction called QNAP or a specified mod@@ us name . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with each of the QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stops must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when the initial template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected a lot of text at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no cl@@ ue on the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparative window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two persons can work independently on one piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der
&quot; opening dialog enables manual insertion of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; through the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A and C , but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging merge , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately set a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , upload them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping text to another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the character A , B , C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; texture &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text already through the automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next solu@@ te / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time must also be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of the position in the windows where the start of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area , and a black bar appears on the left . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark that you might want to copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ fusion conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully follow this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , r@@ unter , page on , beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ start and Ctr@@ l finish , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the input window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ bottom / Ctr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l Inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line end of source files , therefore you should use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ er@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis the numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes . &quot;
&quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is active in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic re @-@ navigation mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and mer@@ ging a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language there is set globally over the control center . ) &quot;
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the selection boxes for coding a brief note of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or reviews columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C will display a second over@@ see column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just shut@@ down the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the mer@@ ging , then the name of last used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this feature e.g. for cutting distur@@ bing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line to convert new@@ letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for another pre @-@ processor command for line synchron@@ ization . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line ab@@ ode algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line control pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot;
... make a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and display the simul@@ ated changes without really performing them
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , folder 3 uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files will be listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by double clicking on the + / - or double clicking on the object and clicking on the arrow keys for left / right .
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the combination pipe action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the A / B / C columns are used in red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders will be considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , becomes red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B a file is ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist can &apos;t be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified , and if the Directory option is synchron@@ ized and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ ename for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is checked , then an error message appears . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folders may not be started . &quot;
&quot; while mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . you state column shows finished when the merge has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all OK . &quot;
&quot; if a consistent analysis method is selected in the Setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the conver@@ sions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target and the two @-@ folder merge will be chosen as target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) to merge the current entry : select action from the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid colli@@ sion actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message appears indicating the incorrect items . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options through , simul@@ ating and Cancel . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , choose another folder merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to re @-@ try the cause of the problem . so you have the option to try another action for the item or to solve the problem in another way before you continue to merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , these entries will not be merged once again . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . there may be several patterns entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively scann@@ ed . ( note that if the option is turned on , the links will lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confidentiality of the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical , if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for consolidation are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file as action is suggested . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is already existing with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this also applies to the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only mer@@ ging whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folders merge view lasts for the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge .
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ reading &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative , or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
sometimes due to the file system on the server sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a diff@@ user in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3 part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is unified in unified format . then , it de@@ cap@@ es &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch file names must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then , the patch starts to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I am using GPL softwares for a long time and have learned a lot by being in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go it like that .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and told the configure script not the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines are different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the right thing but this is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the File Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copy to the clip@@ board and er@@ ase the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed showing the differences . this also leads to the fact that identical files cannot be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result pane ( if you are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , end them or move them . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and Finish . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is ti@@ cked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed with name , the names will be provided with coordinates , &amp; eg ; 1 . work area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop will also appear as background in &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displaying simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n ra@@ ster appear , as well as from P@@ ager @-@ applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ Program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch @-@ on switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can &apos;t be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.@@ g &amp; ke@@ dit . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in default , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that this is not yet able to detect the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firmly and only move the bottom right corner . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will display . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically re@@ stores your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the button P@@ ut document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Re@@ duction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of the screen , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , once the mouse poin@@ ter holds a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ in @-@ jury syndrome ) and those with any mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter continues for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid ache , which occurs when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pulling when the mouse button is pressed . the intelligent shift requires little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before the mouse button is pressed again , if there is no motion of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving up to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System here and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off at first . if you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later attach the intelligent shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not constitute a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the wheel ball , but also the rolls that come in contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the wheels . these are located at the sides of the hole where the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the version of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an im@@ position , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make use of a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to select this way to copy it to the clip@@ board , or to use any other action when you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it . instead , select a mou@@ sec@@ lick at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will display any time when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , which should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and it is correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , and those suffering from the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that it takes a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , you can also drag and drop with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows mu@@ te users to let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the text output of text . for more details see the description of the setup guide . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ code book . from the text@@ books you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the liter@@ ation . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white area in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white area in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ overs and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger and the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the box @-@ card language edition , you enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding that is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text remains unchanged as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; use kt@@ d as language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ d language service is a standardis@@ ed interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text pass@@ agen@@ ook menu or in the bar for text pass@@ code books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant Talk the selected passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected passage is entered at first only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second sel@@ ector closing the edit window for text pass@@ code , you can specify whether the text pass@@ code book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save with the selection of text pass@@ code book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text password is not saved . select Before saving , and ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dictionary for the liter@@ al language . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the dictionary currently used . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you will generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ code books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to delete actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either use the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the sequence of text pass@@ age@@ books or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut off and copied into the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the volume memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the volume memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved from the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable strip for text pass@@ code books will be displayed with entries . by default the toolbar can be moved directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably , you don &apos;t have the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the Map Speech voice output . ( see Settings dialog for Voice Synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / boot . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be app@@ ended . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ha@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending data as standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; code applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use the option as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to set up , use the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally accum@@ ulator for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with which people who cannot speak , can leave text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored which the user can always re@@ print . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de accessibility . the developers can also find the developer at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you must install and correct program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card board speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map card is displayed in General . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; Desktop ; use as the program speed disp@@ ers@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printer sp@@ ills for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card dealer spokes@@ person in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the top speakers appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; new system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a j@@ unk and girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use it ; go back to the map tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; please click on the map jobs to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice delivery system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ d ; this will start the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card orders will be displayed and you can make text orders and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; go ; further , if the field of voice output is enabled ( C@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears when reading the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , stop and record text orders . &quot;
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the map card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card tab General and tick the voice output there ( C@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , check if &amp; k@@ de ; then check the text that is to be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step as well , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then check the text that should be read , and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events you have set . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is delivered to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be accepted in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain defects of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working methods of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the queu@@ ed orders will res@@ ume . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after the issue of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message ab@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg , you can read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order to shoot orders from the map card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; scripts ; just one such pre@@ reads , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters handle the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more kinds of filters .
&quot; string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre@@ defined strings , which enable the creation of chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; XHTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker , for example , if you have a female voice , for example , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language edition . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters , which are set up on the bottom of the page . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the established standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
&quot; for the set @-@ up of strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it must only differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here a language is entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example , the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only type . &quot;
&quot; the string insertion filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character set filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( blan@@ ks ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the expressions ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via PAT@@ H environment variable x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
&quot; the speaker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; t@@ d ; a text to the filter passes , it searches a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker features that the program pres@@ ets , and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card @-@ card speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you can specify the properties of the desired speaker . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must add at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ overs API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to add to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . just launch kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the aforementioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Ren@@ de@@ form filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to use SA@@ BLE at all . you will need to do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you can find the PAT@@ H environment variable . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ or@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , ensure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be remedi@@ ed by a string bag filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license you can find in the accompanying documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the c@@ de@@ accessibility package ; you can also download it . you can also find the code from k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to bro@@ aden it , contact the developer team for the use of another synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; dict@@ ate ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you get the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; get from the source code archive for accessibility or downloaded the tar@@ ball for each night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &apos;re using it , check first whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; ect@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user may leave , repeat or cancel the sentence , or ab@@ ort the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise it is automatically the best suitable speaker chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; Desktop ; select a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Map Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ person on Ad@@ ding , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map card speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the device of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls you can adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them , the voice you choose does not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thereby you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID number on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can move or go backwards in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on the OK button , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , you cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; adjust the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % roughly corresponds to half and 200 free , about double normal speech speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ d system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language records : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and res@@ ists those orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the queu@@ ed orders will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message ab@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can still greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both conduc@@ tive sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the conduc@@ tive sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and screen playback issues , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; drop ; to read K@@ not@@ i@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and / or ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , notices where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; send if somebody men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to determine what &amp; do ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All Not@@ i@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the Save button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex voice and pitch . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; ect@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds do not have to start reading or stop orders more quickly , as only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set limits filter . at the first start of &amp; t@@ ts ; as a specification , a set limits filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional set limits filter , but beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; on the simpl@@ est way , you will learn how to set up the voice selection by trying out . switch on the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch on the voice selection process , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . to do so , you must naturally have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; then faster to start reading , because only the first movement must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limits filter will be set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
column identi@@ fier filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit verification filter maintains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set limits filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file included . &quot;
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the Map Tour Card . the card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , showing all the characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; go ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; otherwise select the speaker , which most likely matches the initially set characteristics . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; here , select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
mark this check box when the property has priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is preferred , if you know that a specific application is sent text in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete , click on the Def@@ ault button and then use a speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if the problem is not resolved , you may need to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , fre@@ ert &amp; dict@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not display this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estival@@ .@@ / voices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be search@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer even on the map card for speaker setup a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; t@@ d ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string bag filter , and now I can go back in &amp; forth ; no longer way to move or go back . on the record pioneer jobs is displayed , the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for set limits instead of these characters . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by calling the command register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflict in the audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and let a text read . you can also fre@@ eze a text order and start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you keep a text order in &amp; ect@@ ts , the current sentence will be read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setup of speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs .
&quot; have you downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure option for activ@@ ating the creation displays the configure parameter which causes the passing of the creation .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . &quot;

&quot; before you are using , check first whether your language synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is disclosed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . to do so , you will find the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; you must compile an additional module for these voices , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; programme and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice delivery system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival produces this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone .
&quot; in this process , additional Wra@@ pper code to festival will be added to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; messages for voice synthesis . note that the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; V@@ oting files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a new version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , which is required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , inser@@ ting the bug fixes is not required , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer which can be controlled in a console ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command to write the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network features enabled . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adaptation of the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best suits the distribution and release status . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you get to the right bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the Set Device dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server in automatic mode . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will send all required TCP / IP information to any system startup , so no further setup is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
the Selection Manu@@ ell can be configured without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; depending on the needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; depending on the needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name with the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls on http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator , part of the name resolution , allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be group@@ ed up or down@@ gra@@ ded in the list by selecting an entry and descending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; the list of name @-@ known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list in particular contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... Man@@ age your machine will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second section , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf &apos;s configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is attribut@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or if available , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 11 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
in this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections so that it is not surprising if in case of active DSL connections a different content is to be found there .
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally modified by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to save several archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar which dar@@ ed to provide the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer will it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; not the pre@@ tension on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be kick@@ ed out without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a type of tape needs to be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not conform to format@@ ting &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive needs to be form@@ atted before use , this must happen before you can be form@@ atted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives normally require a format@@ ting of tape , DAT drives on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band name and the capacity you continue with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the drive for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
&quot; once the scan is started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
the dialog will display the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
&quot; before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialog window will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the job folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ build the band@@ index file on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed in backup files , only the files located on the same fil@@ esystem are stored on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
this delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted , and k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before read / write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , it will be dis@@ car@@ ded when you dis@@ mount &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option from Flo@@ ppy Stream . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware file size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate in each case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted a tape , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file consist of as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . if this is not displayed , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for normal users usually no justi@@ fication for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or entered string . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified , so that only the log lines are displayed in the filter strip . then a protocol line will only display the entry . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding selected column . for example , in the Log File system protocol , select the name of a process , so you will show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of level hint . the color display of protocol lines can be disabled .
&quot; if you want to show only a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , then you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. There are more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for the control of the program starts at startup of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to talk about historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is located on / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to change a machine on System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ed@@ . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; in turn , r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for different places according to the in@@ it program and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the starting field :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find out that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can fix / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have completed something , then you &apos;ll be able to repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line , as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; running a server run@@ level that only runs htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; and I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or move the position within one level by removing it elsewhere . this only happens when you draw an entry from the area of availability system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them to a new level . to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service . &quot;
note : there is no way to restore entries thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with paste ( Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not available or wron@@ g@@ ly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start . &quot;
&quot; after you made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled wild@@ cards ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can set individual settings . additional map cards may appear if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
the Card password management will appear if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD - Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this card @-@ card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user . &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field fil@@ esystem , with space limitation . &quot;
&quot; the map group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group functions analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; this module allows you to install the LI@@ LO System Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to bo@@ oting the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
