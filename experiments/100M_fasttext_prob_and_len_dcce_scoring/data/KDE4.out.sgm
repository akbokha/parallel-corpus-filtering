<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists of showing nested folder hierarchies using a so-called Tree-Map. tree-Maps allows to display the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportionate to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size of a file or folder is mirrored; the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap file represents a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour scheme and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over to color mode, can either show depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordinate rectangles shall be used (which is, therefore, the relative position of lettering in the rectangle)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"display algorithms for Treemaps rule should be complied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always adhered. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is quadratic."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as sharing the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is possible to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods concerning this are rows, columns or recurrent branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu item View on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. and digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that digitiphoto2 thumbnails can be read reliably. Exif support is not used by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to view the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in and digitized; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-in interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules of all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>

<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter works on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed. which fields can be shown you can configure in the dialog of the Albensettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenlistequot; puts an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are stored in a single album room. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date the album was first created. the date can be changed in the features of the album."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the subject is based on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>

<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calmer your monitor because sRGB goes out that your monitor is on sRGB. when you use sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to further manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the features normalize, synchronize, automatic synchronization and contrast expand from the menu Conducting Automatic Correction trying to automatically make your colors the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity across the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its colour shade. this feature is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"similar: this method adjusts the luminaire factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic synchronization: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jiustising of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because a color space is worked with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correcting will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original whiteness immediately, it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminancy of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right up a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum is called Luminancy."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjusting lets you improve the shadows of your photos or even dim them."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences knob restores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"here you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of shell images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in chapter Coloring Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for multiple photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for tone-value correction, you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under paints gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the display has four color effects, a solar panel effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the colour, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the extra light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the extra light. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally produces a negative image that is not to be created on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1), and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon light. in case of large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tonalcorrection is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graphene, three sliders are clicked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use is to shift the controller and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three regulator: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pencils can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to alter the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create an easy image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and then loaded again. to this end, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and Sonnentöne. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image are displayed. the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>

<seg id="479">"and digitized; presents three different tools for sharpening, each one of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it doesn't sharpen a bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images need correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus combined to form a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera is often used internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call up the section called Corrigible sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but they should be careful with this, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique is refocussing the tool. under refocusing, you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften the image a little bit softly and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">Blurry the filter is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first try out the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and impression of grats will create close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught picture one that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpness and therefore avoid flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image is the (2). blurred masquerade was applied with radius = 6.0, Amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used this copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen an image to & quot; refocusserenquot; in which it refocus the defocussing. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus will usually start better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'folding. the auss' folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the sources that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03."</seg>
<seg id="502">"gauge'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge's sharpness. use this parameter if your vague gauge is wrong. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase of the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select big values for the roundness or the gauge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations changes which are not immediately visible, but leave later unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, click on it; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image needs to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field of sharpening in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator smoothes the vagueness of the area of the darkened, in order to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the rider's smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"attention to detail p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture. if greater values are mainly homogeneous region smoothing and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should ensure that no field of sharpening should be subordinated to the directional dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction of direction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film gradation or CCD noises will generate a high value wavy patterns. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, adjust this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm will go through. normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle stepwise since [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only minimal. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. to correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correction errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced settings dialog can remain with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blink the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the depth of field. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak or JPEG artifacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamemance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more roughened, but also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and load: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the file system and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Corrigible softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting. the texture composition is performed by a different tool, the image error correction, and is part of the CImg project by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that can be seen in an uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate darkroom to the picture to be corrected. an automatic process of the dark will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and automatically recharges it in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the digitization; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide-angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo formats, can often not light up the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the lens filter, which increases the necessary closing time under certain circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpened effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's filters and color or grey scale depths of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light gain at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of compensating a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree to compensate."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a more fine adjustment of exposure to the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu Color gradation."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous correction and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitised; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger in the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils, the" "corners" "has the opposite sign of the parameter in general."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thus performs a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will display the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as standard values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the toning or overlap correction should be done before all trimming or size changes. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious to Falsche."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines."</seg>

<seg id="593">"since the filters mix color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind aura in the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known from classic high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix great silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film gradation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, granular view specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="600">The & digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better for large images. flatten the smoothness or, from the other side, the hinge."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the machined is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by rotating the pixels by a central point. this simulates the blurring of a rotational camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurred: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: wipes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening Unity: blurs the image soft into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelgreetings: blurred the image through random displacement of the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurry: finds the ink in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">"some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button."</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can select with the filter; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you restore or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose Transformate Size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many photo editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each image can be enlarged as text file and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo bubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can stop the calculation at any time using the button."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by magnifying a small color image on double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard Augmentation for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create an image. in order to cut a photo you simply have to use the mouse with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool according to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of height and width is assigned to width."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"cutting the tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as standard values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the integration assistance settings allow you to fade help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-rule, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"Golden Center: the golden mean is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blades of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put an image together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographer. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color, you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you do a photo, then it's easy to hold the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digipack; image editing and tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it by pressing the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transformate trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cropping feature. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the turn. but keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be re-calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you will get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to trim the image with converting trimming from image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors."</seg>

<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"the Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to process your pictures frequently or later continue using it, you should not choose the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"the batch mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages you will need to set up some settings. these are divided into three areas, content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you can find more information about export files in."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer is obvious. for example, that all images are shown by a party."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not specifically dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images, so those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not download any pictures, for example a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have fixed. so, he can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image bigger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best of all, select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the root folder in which all of your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added for all future images. here, you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your pictures, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start. the URL you set here should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located."</seg>

<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting pictures that you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="939">"with the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file, copied & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you."</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal ZIP files. since most pictures were compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kin file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories they correspond to your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can synchronize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse pictures and view: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups and mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in representation. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and links & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling takes the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively as the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam each pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by following a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that can be followed individually and examined for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted to the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know it more precisely, search in the source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the borrowed WAV files, the encoder and hence the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the encoder tab. other encoders can be added to this tab itself."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for predefined coefficients. more information about Kodiers can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can receive more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1588">"note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this restricts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and on just 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; you will have a look at the section 'Basic Settings'."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section shows how to see the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equals is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all notes that this instrument needs to put on tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term" "drum patch" "in which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the tone signifies the same drum (as some keyboards possess it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how notes are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is its presence. you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds to the percussions channel. see for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, simply make it in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option may be useful in order to always use the Perkeling patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is given in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is intended to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>

<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most noteworthy enlargement of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language, which you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequent on the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>

<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that the resources be checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for the future users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance when someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2296">"when merging merge, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately set a output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, upload them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at present, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text to another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the character A, B, C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, you can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red for it.

<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)"</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line to convert newletters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add created strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution).</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>

<seg id="2628">"first, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters handle the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to save several archives on a tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar which dared to provide the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer will it take if you secure? "</seg>
<seg id="2894">"before a tape can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2895">"& kdat; trains the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the band. detects & kdat; not the pretension on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"detects & kdat; the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the index should be recreated."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:"</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be recognized by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;"</seg>
<seg id="2901">"a type of tape needs to be formatted before you can be used to store data. this procedure does not conform to formatting & kdat; if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted before use. floppy tape drives normally require a formatting of tape, DAT drives on the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity you continue with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">"once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the drive for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">"once the scan is started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for the check."</seg>
<seg id="2914">The dialog will display the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"before you can redirect the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">"once the recovery process is started, the dialog window will appear. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the job folder for recovery."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"if you have confirmed the restoration settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining."</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to rebuild the bandindex file on the basis of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders listed in backup files, only the files located on the same filesystem are stored on the same filesystem as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">This deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted, and kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before read / write operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"is the option turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is turned on, it will be discarded when you dismount & kdat; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option from Floppy Stream."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option is turned on, try & kdat; to change the hardware file size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you need to communicate in each case the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; formatted a tape, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file consist of as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups."</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions, including:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. if this is not displayed, and it opens up instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for normal users usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or entered string. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified, so that only the log lines are displayed in the filter strip. then a protocol line will only display the entry. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding selected column. for example, in the Log File system protocol, select the name of a process, so you will show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of level hint. the color display of protocol lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), then you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case use filter strip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There are more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init rapidly develops into the standard for the control of the program starts at startup of the system in the & Linux; world. and, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to talk about historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is located on / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to change a machine on System V Init without reinstalling and reformated. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"in turn, rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places according to the init program and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the starting field:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find out that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can fix / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have completed something, then you'll be able to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line, as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; running a server runlevel that only runs httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; and I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc;."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within one level by removing it elsewhere. this only happens when you draw an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them to a new level. to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with paste (Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrongly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to start."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled wildcards (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can set individual settings. additional map cards may appear if Shadow -Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Card password management will appear if Shadow -Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD - Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card-card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user."</seg>
