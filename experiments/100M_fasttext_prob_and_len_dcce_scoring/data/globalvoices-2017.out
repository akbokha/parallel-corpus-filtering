&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ ician , who wanted to occupy the top German court with judges who were inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method You , &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very shy love letter about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he handles his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as it is said so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague expressed it , and openly declare his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one ever attained by the party nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , who takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also the Tr@@ um@@ ps world view did not coinci@@ de with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Bac@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump was on its way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; dealing with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters to be ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful , and implies an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that voters , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this Whit@@ el@@ ash ( An@@ m d. Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; whit@@ ening of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; spokes@@ man from white in reference to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ( which means so much like ch@@ and@@ eli@@ ers ) , as the great Van Jones had , exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a vast majority of the white Americas this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , would have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; he received an unanim@@ ous and silent &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love for music through gar@@ bage .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Wa@@ ste
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically on the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with recycled instruments made from local fixed waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycled materials under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , reminds himself of the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
&quot; as F@@ avi@@ o , this changed something which he had never seen before : a violin made out of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; today there is an entire orchestra , which plays instruments from recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here she transforms him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illeg@@ ally fishing before it looked up the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and slightly inclined to welcome a legislative break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to collect one of their ports and also refused to share a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries , who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior vice @-@ president of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had driven Prime Minister from their waters back then . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries , which are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand out to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to catch up . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fish@@ eries can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries circul@@ ated , the actions now happen in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange existing lic@@ ences with each other , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships , when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , there are suspic@@ ious routes to discover - such as that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal report . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; its practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licence documents , indication of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately utili@@ se the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You are not going to run my harbour &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread frau@@ dul@@ ent licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found wing@@ ed ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international criminal authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines different information levels with each other , and F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of every single tra@@ ck@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships , which used to f@@ end without a license and hardly had consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats have purchased more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to trace Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also recognize these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions as well , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia had its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition to a referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al of Venezuela , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return or@@ ber@@ nation of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates what is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the rel@@ uc@@ tance of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and powers are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is concerned , the referendum on the term im@@ itation was considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Conference ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the prot@@ esters called for the support of the National Assembly on 27 October . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3rd November all after Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The Rec@@ on@@ struction of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ northern city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ dians do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographi@@ cs already makes the round , which forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ se process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your exercise !
on the road !
&quot; other values of this protest as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from its point of view , have taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather be concerned with mu@@ til@@ ating critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are gaining increasing frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as the now adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the Province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he retained the sec@@ rec@@ y of the family .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child at the age of 15 you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis has no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of Secret Order No. 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ ved data .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy and who said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole . you are friends with one of the ERP systems .
just make sure they don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because so my father had educated me . &quot;
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times a week to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
since the prisoners are tor@@ tured the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I looked in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they rarely bond a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ench there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wine .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell immediately and I realized that that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried and blind@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down@@ wards - all were tied in hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people locked sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; Why did you bring me otherwise ? &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told home about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero attacked a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was accused of death of the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apping came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this way and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War@@ &apos; prey &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they knew it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ onet or perhaps army badges , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and ste@@ al the refrigerator , record player , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war @-@ loo@@ t but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I wouldn &apos;t like to enter a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied : &quot; &quot; and you , who l@@ acks cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and will kill you by yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ up pul@@ lover from wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but nevertheless he brought home clothes . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so , during the dictatorship , you have executed people . &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them in jail .
&quot; I suppose it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families to whom to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grinding and absent somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something remains always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
&quot; the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he said only &quot; &quot; Na then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I converted the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : among them serious , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 cases of severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of a under 10 year old child . &quot;

the verdi@@ cts in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally committed in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for justice for years for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ F.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was able to build a memorial site , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can extend their driving licence , in the last month , witnesses to a very un@@ fortunate translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; old motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; on a shield , fal@@ sely , but perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant ind@@ w@@ elling &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos shared many times in social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local papers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper , which is published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the excuse :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; the police said . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt with more detail with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are nationwide in accidents , is quite grounds for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors amounted to 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter , named in particular , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly wei@@ rd vs. older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the Website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , who could translate translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations in their company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious pro@@ positions created by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling sus@@ pen@@ ders , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from big companies or the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were also no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itters were also taking pictures of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had deleg@@ ated the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court herself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was ch@@ apped and advised users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental ven@@ eers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and fin@@ ish@@ ings when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; amazing , that it is still more affordable than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds to errors or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was broadcast on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custo@@ dy . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custo@@ dy .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ an an increasingly difficult access to multimedia coverage of the current happ@@ enings in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain an education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies of other cri@@ es who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a report by Kur@@ tural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ elas que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ ta is called Cri@@ adi@@ ta , the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ passes her son or her son &apos;s daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ mean is in general shut down . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; can be transferred to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will only learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra was killed as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín , until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go buried deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest protests and urged that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
their brothers now had to work all and began selling swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the home of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she stood up against five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she never got unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was forced to stand alongside him and read editorial newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe the reports of official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought it intellig@@ ently , but didn &apos;t stop with her . &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while he was talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak to their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she had received from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the ch@@ ic@@ anas that cri@@ es cri@@ es when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have friends in school or in the neighborhood .

the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric ma@@ ids can be shared in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administrators are P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a counc@@ ill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ ón &apos;s district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday when possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ñ@@ u@@ z@@ by wrote that she had a year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad once more :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ Ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were ens@@ la@@ ved and turned to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to ens@@ la@@ ve them ) and the Spanish conquest of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the representation of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

released under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; regulations regarding use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media must be registered in Egypt at a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is assigned to give citizens permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a cash bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video chess and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is adopted if it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose the registration . it is uncle@@ ar how they should account for those who are not currently in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Promot@@ er of the Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and received a username and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation to come through the fire@@ wall that Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to educ@@ ate a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they are for@@ ci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will establish a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MEP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence was envis@@ aged for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; prot@@ esting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq marked by war

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; the Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) are a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the free game run@@ way is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately demonstrates another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , which was responsible for the north @-@ east Japan to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring groups Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , therefore , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress made six years later to re@@ build local residents &quot; lives . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( the &quot; &quot; Kaz@@ ak@@ su Y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) was to be reloc@@ ated into final replacement houses for six years . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which hau@@ led after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were settled into final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the status of works and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to detect , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster have opened its doors until December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have res@@ um@@ ed their operation . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , where only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land could be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; barrier zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far down . &quot;
&quot; the tour@@ istical numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to find an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also intensi@@ fied its attention to the situation of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation centres from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres , which still live in homes , are older than 50 years old . the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem initially greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one realis@@ es that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries .
&quot; Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ty explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely known photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered to be critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the police officers face the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
the images show the police official as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; would a police officer be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive ward , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken from Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and a few plum@@ bers rus@@ hed to him shortly . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber sho@@ ots and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media has conce@@ aled road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ ating their cover pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are carried out by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of Un@@ disp@@ uted Vill@@ ages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories closed doors in all Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) . &quot;
&quot; the popular congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after suc@@ cum@@ bed to the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls just to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive they were intoler@@ able for the country .
&quot; initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which were only distingu@@ ish@@ able to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the breast@@ feeding factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still under operation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved , against his will , at the stopp@@ age of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assem@@ bles one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industry of Cuba and the most important working plate producer has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work stations and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former President saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory ended , or rather , when they began to dis@@ assemble them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;

first Nations Young People use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ We J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop managers have brought mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by peda@@ go@@ gues David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop gives rise to the fact that young participants talk about topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a stop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever wanted to be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day you will take our scre@@ am .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and move forward as well as our youth &quot;
&quot; in this way , they can do what the Creator has appointed for . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse in sil@@ ben@@ script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( in the case of a typical restaurant in Japan ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ a , there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not notice them even more . however , a new trend today transforms them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new plastic straps decorated with plastic straps as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to mos@@ qu@@ ito coll@@ ecti@@ bles , as in this case , fri@@ dges mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming more and more complex .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; W@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon che@@ ating ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which includes the &quot; &quot; # tations &quot; , &quot; which includes # tations . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ a , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of in- and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely supp@@ ressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( English : &quot; learning to live with the drug trade &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people who came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as much as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches for every weekend secret gra@@ ves to his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on just a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we asked ourselves to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15 he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay them out , because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where shall we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I come across every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from actors of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them too . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring location will be justified , that they were &quot; up@@ set . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to say that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and are silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months ext@@ or@@ tion in the capital district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als pressed money from their business for month , until they were torn apart not only the business , but also torn apart their family . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear is coming back high once you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn from violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who saw bloody cor@@ p@@ ses of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when he was forced by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Public Security Council and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links , contain images showing violence . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false dup@@ lication of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it poses questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . &quot;
trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to it . &quot;
&quot; representative representative described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses wrapped up including a cin@@ em@@ as near , which was full of people who watched the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses burned and ch@@ ased cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make up the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ic bodies lying on the ground while people watch it .
but here the story does not end its end .
&quot; over the years the same picture has been published several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened to Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ loon . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count dead , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted visually .
&quot; the cause of the attack was also uncle@@ ar , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the image from DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ings ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; further , personal comments such as this example mis@@ lead the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Mos@@ lem Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could escape blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ di@@ fied Arab news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to get this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Sein to this statement , but had not connected the image from DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; one can see how far information can go beyond borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images ( status of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed @-@ m@@ ash of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of the abuse of abuse and linked them with the respective countries , on which side they had been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for abuse . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely sc@@ aled ( on the card in orange ) :

&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which presum@@ ably took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ pt ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , it translated discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to un@@ subscribe . &quot;
&quot; from the emb@@ assy in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner &apos;s mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos stood apart . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and sometimes they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the end of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( em@@ bedding ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life , both are important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are thre@@ es@@ core people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real horror of what happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the with@@ holding of pictures of a refusal equ@@ als to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that for@@ ci@@ bly ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investigated how violent media are working on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think carefully about the situation in which an image is suggest@@ ing something , which can actually be used to be used from the context or entirely ab@@ usi@@ ve manner . &quot;
each study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated .
&quot; such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you will find words from the Mw@@ amp@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ an your parents in recognition of how they tried to do you in your younger years . &quot;
words in H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil like :
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country occurred over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following a statement by the cat@@ astrop@@ hic force of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 men were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud waves . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 secure places of residence . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after other rain@@ falls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents locked in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
different organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with flood and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need bring security and aid assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; used permission . Dam@@ als in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children , she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we chant rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other chann@@ eling plots against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in its conception . &quot;
they kid@@ n@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who , as I do not fit in , must be eliminated . &quot;
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as is the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have colon@@ ised western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and su@@ cking Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a mighty group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong scar weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken of American land by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave @-@ ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has been so deep and flaw@@ ed by our collective imagination that Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are often aimed at anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create tri@@ po@@ ds that help us to understand the world .
and my industry is keen to compreh@@ end the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ethnic Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers , and sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American stat@@ or from Bangladesh called Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan was re@@ covering the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ ref@@ utable Muslims and Americ@@ an@@ ists ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket peb@@ bles that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ t , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ scarf to a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they fall back on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , would see my neighbor , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslim if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I we@@ ave her in my arms and her the Arab se@@ duction to protect the Koran and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

being Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; being Muslim is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - colon@@ ized by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company established with the name Hon@@ orable British East @-@ Indian Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be a Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have been colon@@ ized by four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aviation bomb of history was thrown over a Muslim country in a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried among the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy the USA is visiting and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four thousand years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion involves more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing bil@@ ty &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and to build all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim region , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that ex@@ cludes its limits to people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely increases Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we are leading , and the bombs which we surrender to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University showed a scientifically correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to guide
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the defective and dangerous print@@ outs that we maintain in our news section . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but which made me today an irre@@ voc@@ able Muslim . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may evoke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity constitutes , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;

&quot; we must ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to rep@@ j@@ at the &quot; other . &quot; as my girl@@ friend and I have been in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , which attacks chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; telling stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to connect to someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn P@@ erry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the unmistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the world languages can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; while &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening to the audience , to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language first and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and representation lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
they cry laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !

&quot; on 3 April 2017 , various religious and ci@@ vic organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march started with the Pu@@ ertor@@ te Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the Grupp@@ o &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( ci@@ vic front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) , and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot;
the inter@@ cess@@ ors of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions related remun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state alliance integrated territory of the US - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , is a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside are under threat without the participation and persu@@ asion of citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing manager at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by book Spr@@ ints : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective After@@ math ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how mot@@ ions are built for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in custo@@ dy by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and attorney N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; ported Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as insi@@ der of the Assad administration and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project based in Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ing than the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would all set out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
this stri@@ pe into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life on dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is ro@@ yalty @-@ free available .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that each of the haz@@ ards doesn &apos;t matter to me
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the jail of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
who I wear with my passion
if your eyes say good@@ bye
and I have another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
to bring back all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;

and you are still in the cage of monsters
the history of Bas@@ que is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ k : convic@@ ted of corruption sentenced director after release on previous post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption case , in which a government member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other def@@ end@@ ants because of un@@ disp@@ uted 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approx . 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his res@@ et@@ ting to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which adverti@@ sed the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post , as the company did not fulfil any discipline proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not have the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ a de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the Director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we should be aware of is that the company should have directed a disciplinary procedure against the acting .
&quot; however , the company seems to be silent and no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; vile &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
approx@@ . price *
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not b@@ other morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he s@@ worn him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lack@@ ed mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served himself in the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state to act as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally condemned to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to recall that a th@@ ief is in jail : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remember the Mozambique @-@ Afri@@ cans forever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , Cutter and - by the way - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous verbal presentation was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rej@@ ecting :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he spo@@ ils money , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ю@@ т@@ к &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or spac@@ ers .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network recorded their posts on the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; large @-@ scale &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dism@@ al con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not automatically cry out hate speech . &quot;
context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that there were also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use .
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written in Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Facebook user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , if they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will l@@ essen hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all posts which are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you &apos;re writing on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words adjacent . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( ages ) .
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ b its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t elu@@ ci@@ date the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have prohibited such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le amongst users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which no hate speech contained , but nevertheless were removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese lyrics are &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word cal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then do you heal people ? &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally address violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ation hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , more focused on context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is an end to child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to offer this practice , so that the recommended age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that does not signi@@ fy the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened not@@ with@@ standing the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s rights convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; each person under 18 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were anx@@ ious to aboli@@ sh laws on child marriage followed at the foot and gr@@ ati@@ fying themselves with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u guide , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the cri@@ b of the child before , they should be dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; yet at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one voted against it . &quot;
&quot; after he had previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws on the orph@@ an@@ age were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is facing a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ises the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and it &apos;s worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel had the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ proof age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; today , on 9 June 2017 , the draft for the amend@@ ment of the E@@ states Act was decided . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
all dep@@ u@@ ties who were present have voted for the law .
the child marriage is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ sex shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; however , a potential catch occurs in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the General Secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aja announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate in a different way . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather , instead of speaking of the problem that we , instead of speaking of the problem , we would say that the state , our daughters from before , would protect them that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ t@@ apped men who are facing them in their advantage , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that under@@ line them . &quot;

&quot; although many techniques @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use circum@@ navigation tools for blocked websites ( a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has blocked article from Wikipedia , as recently blocked in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now multiple mirrors ( sites that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put down all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blo@@ gger IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set all about mapping Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read content on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni subscri@@ bed Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one access@@ es another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia site so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is carried out by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ pers@@ ent Rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to recti@@ fy the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the border of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly in Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he was already on the face of the Tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ wei@@ k appeared . he went straight away , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am g@@ ay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should ab@@ stain the standard of preserving this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having contacted a married k@@ ins@@ man with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of calling their wives also not by their names is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health guards as well as house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became quickly to the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the details of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as child marri@@ ages to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
she tells how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by their names .
she chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands not to speak out loud , is a custom that they all have to be du@@ tiful and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband so far , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women must never pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she stood before herself during the whole exercise , and another decided to release the whole increased fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ bing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and told her that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead indicating the married status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ff dot if he did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped with it , but they think they are now in a better position to self @-@ choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip on every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in recent months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; it &apos;s okay for most people , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t trust . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed Roh@@ ini put their own pair of cur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a round@@ table so that the women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming to the reels : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then again listened to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and do not have any other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their life - like the viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les Mem@@ ories &quot; &quot; in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! the Beat@@ les Mem@@ or@@ y@@ day is in Japan today . it &apos;s 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that relate to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , you are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum )
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial .
&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course some companies use the fan base from the market , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?

male @-@ faced men are kid@@ n@@ apped and killed in Mozambique

&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of people for the organ trade , presum@@ ably for the pur@@ ring purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been extracted .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a person of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the objective of mur@@ ders for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the UN 2016 , in the South African country , conducted a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the mos@@ que police warned according to the latest mur@@ ders of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ ination took place . &quot;
&quot; hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that local police are already following the fall : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of cat @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ; this also dict@@ ates the police of the Republic of Mozambique in view ( PR@@ M ) , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches of gen@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE gladly emp@@ ower ONE MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH , a country where the people would have ashamed to go to the street , and to take sex against good notes , a nation in which the people would be ashamed or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os would be hun@@ ted or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; , &quot; which aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt sympathy to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , his wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who were spending themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ tion &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials knew that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we all prove the prestige of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have worked for his release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , so the organization of the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or for@@ ci@@ bly disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions were exposed . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custo@@ dy , so the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and President Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ p@@ ate Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after announc@@ ing his lawyer at the end of June , that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after taking part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an internal affair and nar@@ rated a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
unified Nations
&quot; R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to undergo treatment . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into shock after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon exports to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as announced in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
they are to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he could help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on 27 June that the emb@@ assy intends to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :

France &apos;s foreign ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;

&quot; on 27 June , the Council of Agr@@ arian Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectu@@ ally Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama :
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 , around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for which he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may appear sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international scale . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the bi@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , whereby most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io &apos;s blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; reverse the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercising of power in Singapore .
&quot; then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equal cities which are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end Democrats to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distor@@ ted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests about our press , our judicial representative , and our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he asked questions of rational nature with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he pointed out to the critics that one should start reading the full address of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am as the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ assem@@ bles the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am committed a mistake , or was it a Freu@@ dian slip @-@ up speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why does the people of Singapore make their military service , they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , expands , and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or homeland ? &quot;
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question posed most to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other them . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - against Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; apparently , we often say &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country for ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it would be nothing to me , if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice .
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be fun - like the good , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a basic achievement of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open friendliness that I have now found with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has just made Canada sexy . &quot;
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop @-@ band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ unded the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his girl@@ friend &apos;s instructions .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the country &apos;s position under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos from the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian Section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; change in settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and uncle@@ ar rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , supervised by online content and people accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand establishes a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Most Great ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; the video even shows how people are thrown into a black v@@ aul@@ ted cart before putting them into an intern@@ ment store , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band , which im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ electric bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for so@@ vie@@ we@@ es in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost@@ s in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for rab@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after it has barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages free of charge . &quot;

&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter , and insi@@ sts that she is instead supported by her young grand@@ son . &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;

but we cannot always do that - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;

&quot; together with her husband and the five common children , G@@ aly@@ an has lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .

it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy pursu@@ es him afterwards .

a group of children now tracks the ball .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , she knows many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 Dollar the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside . &quot;
she wants to reject nobody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medication which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bar@@ t ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family arrived from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to arrive to Boston , to find her husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always remain in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get an appropriate price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;

&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single trav@@ eller , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travellers consult their teleph@@ ones quietly . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of Twitter users , which is made by Twitter users &quot;
&quot; residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that &quot; &quot; the app &quot; &quot; should prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also knew how to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police report that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online , and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the children &apos;s filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Consumer China &quot; ( which was published in the list of the p@@ opping up news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers random@@ ly checked the inhabitants if they had installed the Surveillance App . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are using a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the passwords for a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the cy@@ ber security office instructions to operate their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this action does not viol@@ ate Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
Foto by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved after and after , revealing a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all glory to its name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , beautiful scenes and the performer , the characters turn into being of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth rot@@ ates on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were thrown out of the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters of the city were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high expectations of a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped functioning in the quarter . &quot;
I broke through the silence by crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice rel@@ uc@@ tant because of the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were alli@@ ed to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t be interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; Make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice back , after you have cried out the whole way up to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say , &quot; Let me also hear how you scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were upon me .
and you g@@ rie@@ ve what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret the word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately . &quot;
&quot; his father , right away . &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ ede all details just before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ guy was a &quot; self @-@ mate . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be recognized by me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ eled in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that shows us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( such as : &quot; &quot; th@@ under &quot; , &quot; all@@ usion on the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated .
&quot; thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state security from us and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ out cards and betra@@ yed the close vision of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ive him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube probably from the l@@ ump .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
my cri@@ es liked him not enough so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them alternate , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and did not find any fav@@ ours , which is why he interven@@ ed as a neighbour to an electrically loaded stick . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Arsch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he v@@ ows to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( for example : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a human , &quot; while in water he sha@@ kes Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , there is a lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm coffee and ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water to drink - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic Action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual Fron@@ ts@@ än@@ ger , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ u@@ ties and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the time @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la cher@@ ished the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply a kind of rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b carried out traditional sex rhyth@@ ms to his body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently d@@ wind@@ ed woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still more difficult that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; be held in jail for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not take anything . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues which have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not capable of separating his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; politics was sm@@ itten , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it Faith or Non @-@ belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or Homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comment@@ aries on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to later notice that his comments were drawn from the context , distor@@ ted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , stre@@ amed but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not about Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who later would work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ iers not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they would have cri@@ tically expressed themselves on comments in social media about the problems linked with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how it looks like h@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; experience it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be crow@@ ned with music , art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , scatter uni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ sions , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed carri@@ ages are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and yet a stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Nab@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a yard of 18 meters was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; outw@@ ard@@ ly outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ kers and illegal drug trade are comm@@ on@@ place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for cosmetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the sty@@ ling of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the bar@@ ber art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; love messages of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación campaign ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write down gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters . &quot;
recently their country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC Guer@@ illa Defense Forces that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - which is to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
&quot; the idea for letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we are the people we love to write on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; in this year he plans to share his love with people , who needed most urgently . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of encour@@ agement from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; said the writer Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the Gover@@ nor of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters lived ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody wrote something such a beautiful thing , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat next to the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was also tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start of the meeting , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more equ@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this scale is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives does hurt me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many ex @-@ fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming there would have been peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms , rise and protest for their rights . and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will im@@ min@@ ent many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hangs like a sword of D@@ amo@@ cles over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only created overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published which discussed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that in reality she was a woman .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ sh@@ es had experienced the sex adjustment of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
she moved out of fear for her life in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was an honorary hel@@ per for a human rights organization .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been placed - in men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name on it . but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for it .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they wanted to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only cor@@ rupted your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with blin@@ ding windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering without me , without ID , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you wouldn &apos;t believe , you &apos;d be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you put in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equ@@ ation , that is a tab@@ oo theme . &quot;
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best in order not to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have fallen behind ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not finish a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; thus , I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end they demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to place themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show off their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there have been nothing new since then .
they just took them with them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know , whether these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already well known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , carried tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Security Department of the Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me even a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : Khar@@ kov ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long has this grace period lasted ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel the people in the city started to change . &quot;
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I have discovered these people by myself when I stum@@ bled away .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ go ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
&quot; this is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Paz@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have whatever ; on the whole planet there is them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so I am uncomfortable to hear such things . &quot;
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ tions to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not at all sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ killing . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th reg@@ ained the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly manage to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ eg@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August , within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ ath , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed themselves this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of supporting their families , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and made an effort in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , labour and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ is who were looking for a job , completed the primary school , had completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ an human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ mad @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic per@@ spir@@ es emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i and to be questioned as even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ j@@ i have to endure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even stack well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists .
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is well known to me and known .
I am convinced and I bond twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LGB@@ TI community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention what kind of physical , spiritual and verbal mis@@ use , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not associate myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account un@@ righteousness in her mind , which refers to both the sex and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a ent@@ men@@ s@@ worn and margin@@ alized being in a historic sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the significance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women more information a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana , anism : recall ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create rooms where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle up against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled throughout the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the flow that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film in Er@@ bil , in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on trac@@ ed , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ tural . &quot;
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez saw nothing more useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her display . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women provide an indication , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , admit to be victims of violence , are at all reporting to the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ts@@ 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ k@@ 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that contains nothing less than 3 of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence in the County State Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of the ads of women came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who reports in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse will come to two women who do not do so , &quot; she concluded at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own crime , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible ab@@ uses and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then there was still . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years , she carried the psych@@ ic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable : &quot;
I never thought that I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report the ill @-@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the agencies in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , it received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner , which developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and its home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach - flaw@@ ed implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ales d declares to be an independent crime stock and to pun@@ ish tough@@ er , as has already been the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legislative text was changed in some respects to also win the MEPs for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is pun@@ ish@@ able up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had envis@@ aged most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must be borne by the victims of violence by themselves , if they simply furnis@@ h ad and wish to receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , ill @-@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the wron@@ g@@ do@@ ers will escape . &quot;
we have to equi@@ p so long as ill treatment is no longer considered to be normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the administration of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;
&quot; this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ tural . &quot;

independent media perpet@@ rated in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he was sentenced to one year imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Te@@ eth al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried to court , but later they were released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had depos@@ ited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state empire . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s reign is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially the secret of domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to torture and in@@ sti@@ gate independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judge of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a judgment in a her@@ itance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Te@@ eth al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited to the Special Division from ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed for an in@@ definite period of time , after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both found guilty of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on public@@ ity and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition a one @-@ year vocational ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damage deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was released and he was released from custo@@ dy on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al dismis@@ sed Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dischar@@ ged from the central prison sentence in Mas@@ k@@ at on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he will serve his prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper is still exposed to attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ vert the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Gulf Centre for Human Rights : &quot;
1 . allow You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization providing human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for medical research conducted on site , there are two reasons : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks for a private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being makers of themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
e @-@ mail : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously had ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards developed in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
- What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ eful@@ ness , and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more Sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ el varieties . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer , since his work becomes more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river there would be a b@@ oul@@ der around which I must d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed any new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman mers@@ burger Type Out@@ red@@ ness in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed produced by them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; open Source &quot; gro@@ wers only allow others to buy seeds , cross it to breed their own varieties , and it does not immediately sow it - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I Board Member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants both important for food security and environmental protection .
&quot; seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered on farmers markets in August and September 2016 . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to making their seed available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available genetic pool is shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , engaged in her doc@@ torate with gene@@ tically variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are still no such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that massive con@@ gest@@ ed plants like wheat are patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ bilities
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desirable characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves , through which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and prevent threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ able due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property enables other bre@@ eders to promote innovation as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innov@@ ate . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation but also promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public .
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , there are certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to breed with plants , which are adapted to the changed environment conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the attributes themselves . &quot;
the plants are formed by themselves and as bre@@ eders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US State Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for their cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des that breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such companies moving on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my ri@@ vals are selling my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it really easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the U.S. seems to be the leader in the &quot; open source , &quot; the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ da works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find out about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official start of the official start of the year should be planned . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context , from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block contents on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook in which it strongly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , e.g. the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web @-@ sei@@ s@@ closures have fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main datas@@ ets for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ M@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , also on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for spreading columns and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog which he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which is also located in the country of Canada , is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ last@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; I succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; An arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons on the national security council , the block@@ age blogs and any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous walk the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers , through the implementation of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the V@@ PN@@ s , began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day by day newspapers in all Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; ebe rau@@ ts chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air @-@ side to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become comm@@ on@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what is happening in Rio is published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
an extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that didn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes further : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ elia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that the violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing that this is a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ fal@@ si@@ fying negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is ranked 16th , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ elia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police unit and permanently station one unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio did not meet the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to deplo@@ y means and paths typical of war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; where a Zi@@ vi@@ list is an in@@ significant point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or war , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week , it is now time for the police to climb up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit merchant died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massac@@ res are committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally sour@@ ced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional ones in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . but their food , however , makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direc@@ tor@@ ship of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 family knowledge to the creation of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , 04 September 2017 , still raise funds on cand@@ o . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds origin@@ ating from the regions &quot; &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , mushrooms have been distributed free of charge anywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and si@@ ege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese claim justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires on 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery alone 2017 in Portugal approximately 500,000 acres of forest burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
&quot; so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire only in 4 districts . &quot;
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users split images :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the federal government of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy as in June could happen again since the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;

&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to expand after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems came to the conclusion that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as inhabitants of information sought or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and the spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan began . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say that at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
at dawn the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .
the city of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that which was left of his modest wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar that were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; he remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t fre@@ eze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high intake quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepar@@ atory personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an admission centre , if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined livel@@ ihood helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was putting his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he still opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ limb@@ us .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; documentary ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim to return to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af , with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all the others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would need to be able to use the social networks , register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who negl@@ ect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final judgment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal in which harder sanctions would be introduced to ins@@ ult the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the off@@ ending of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned prisoners . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he showed violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ itation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 demonstr@@ ators arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a court . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the detention of human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of among other things cease @-@ possession , illegal assembly , murder and murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza exemp@@ ted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist list@@ ens to sk@@ ill@@ ful documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily inter@@ rog@@ ated by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , was explicitly endor@@ sed by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , was expressly granted a controversial bill of law , accused of business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of giving back all illegal money . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on 21 April , sheds light on how the pres@@ sive plans for the support of the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to nom@@ inate his sources , stating from Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
the rules will also indicate that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register with the provincial government as &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law allows the government to take responsible services for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned by Web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
tur@@ k@@ ish Court locks Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish judgment decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the particulars , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was banned because it led to &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to have a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has om@@ itted other technology companies and civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
