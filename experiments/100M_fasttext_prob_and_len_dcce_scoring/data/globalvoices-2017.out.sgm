<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, how he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magician, who wanted to occupy the top German court with judges who were inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method You," I was like it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shy love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he handles his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as it is said so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague expressed it, and openly declare his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number one ever attained by the party nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, who takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also the Trumps world view did not coincide with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Bacey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was on its way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"dealing with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook those things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this Whitelash (Anm d. Ü): as much as" "whitening of the whites against all other ethnicities" "; spokesman from white in reference to the Whites and Whiplash (which means so much like chandeliers), as the great Van Jones had, exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast majority of the white Americas this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, would have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received an unanimous and silent" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later, he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is Trumps Country, the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with gleaming eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste materials:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recycled instruments made from local fixed waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled materials under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, reminds himself of the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"as Favio, this changed something which he had never seen before: a violin made out of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today there is an entire orchestra, which plays instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people of Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here she transforms him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play from garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegally fishing before it looked up the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and slightly inclined to welcome a legislative breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to collect one of their ports and also refused to share a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries, who simply refused everything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior vice-president of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillaging the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had driven Prime Minister from their waters back then."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries, which are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand out to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to catch up. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fisheries can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by snail-empo, with the information between individual countries circulated, the actions now happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licences with each other, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships, when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, there are suspicious routes to discover - such as that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal report."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"its practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, indication of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You are not going to run my harbour'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and precisely this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fraudulent licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple deceitful identities and it has pursued and found winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international criminal authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Head Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines different information levels with each other, and FISH-i will help to find criminally acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oceana Marine Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of every single trackable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that's just sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which used to fend without a license and hardly had consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats have purchased more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to trace Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also recognize these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions as well," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia had its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the secrecy of the family.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought that was fine."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times a week to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything was possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Since the prisoners are tortured the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and metal feathers.</seg>

<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>

<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>

<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely feel that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) in our part," the police said. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with more detail with the phenomenon of" "terrible" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are nationwide in accidents, is quite grounds for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors in 2005, equivalent to a 10% share."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, who could translate translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still produce translations in their company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious propositions created by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling suspenders, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from big companies or the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="419">"shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"she said," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. when Criadita is called Criadita, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money overpasses her son or her son's daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked to Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Crimean is in general shut down."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "can be transferred to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies their exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance, who would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved."</seg>

<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly after she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was a Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira was killed as long as a stick on Marín, until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo buried deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest protests and urged that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>

<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the home of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up against five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was done with learning, the more free time it had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she never got unlimited food." I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to draft legislation on" "regulations regarding use and use of social networks." ""</seg>

<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>

<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is adopted if it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who are not currently in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>

<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will establish a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator exists."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the free game runway is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring groups Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had lost whole coastal towns from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, therefore, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress made six years later to rebuild local residents" lives. "</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>

<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima accounts for 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (the" "Kazaksu Yutaku" ") was to be relocated into final replacement houses for six years."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuation centres from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which hauled after the disaster in temporary shelters, were settled into final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to detect, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by the disaster have opened its doors until December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours in Fukushima have resumed their operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred large-scale in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, where only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland could be used again in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands of Fukushima are located in the" "nuclear" "barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far down."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the touristical numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coasters, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to find an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated ones. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed towards the tsunami-risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>

<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also intensified its attention to the situation of the Fukushima evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness of the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuation centres from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuation centres, which still live in homes, are older than 50 years old. the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'We Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'We Jinan-Tour, workshop managers have brought mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop gives rise to the fact that young participants talk about topics like" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always master the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a stophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever wanted to be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our scream.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"thus, they can grow and move forward as well as our youth"</seg>
<seg id="712">"in this way, they can do what the Creator has appointed for."</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastics models of the dishes" "), which is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappa, there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not notice them even more. however, a new trend today transforms them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"with Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic straps decorated with plastic straps as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were converted to mosquito collectibles, as in this case, fridges magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, a kaans-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon cheating?. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other scurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, which includes the" "# tations", "which includes # tations."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappa, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="746">"for the victims of the fight against drug traffickers,"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of in- and foreign media about the notorious" "struggle against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely suppressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(English:" learning to live with the drug trade "), which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people who came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as much as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"one main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches for every weekend secret graves to his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew on just a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we asked ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15 he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to my father's insurance, but she does not pay them out, because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where shall we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come across every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from actors of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroism "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become mere numbers in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring location will be justified, that they were" upset. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to say that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and are silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months extortion in the capital district: how a family has been plundered with threats. "it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month, until they were torn apart not only the business, but also torn apart their family."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear is coming back high once you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are removed, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn from violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, tortillas warm, and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, who saw bloody corpses of his father who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when he was forced by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Public Security Council and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 3103 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it poses questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated."</seg>

<seg id="836">What happened to Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowloon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count dead," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the cause of the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the image from DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misdemeanings; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"further, personal comments such as this example mislead the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Moslem Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee could escape blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an acidified Arab news site, which in 2012 falsely claimed that President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to get this information."</seg>

<seg id="912">"this article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by Boko Haram publishes from the now deleted, the Catholic-related news site Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image is not from the killings, but it claims that it is a" similar djihadist attack. ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015, the newspaper El Pais attempted to refute that there were connections to Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="914">"Turkey, 2015." # NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy "(Nigeria burns, the world is asleep)."</seg>
<seg id="915">"the image of the DR Congo appeared with this twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris."</seg>
<seg id="916">"they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events, which presumably took place in the name of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was taken as a testament to the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retwept). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message that was allegedly written by a" father Juan Carlos Martos "about the Nigerian massacre, it translated discussion forums such as this in Vietnamese and explained it to unsubscribe."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretiner's missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos stood apart."</seg>
<seg id="923">"there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina."</seg>
<seg id="924">"TinEye also points to other accounts, generators and pages in the following countries (on the cap in grey), but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (embedding) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life, both are important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are threescore people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue, and the real horror of what happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"an argument is that the withholding of pictures of a refusal equals to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that forcibly ensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigated how violent media are working on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will need to think carefully about the situation in which an image is suggesting something, which can actually be used to be used from the context or entirely abusive manner."</seg>
<seg id="940">Each study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named Untranslatable (e. g. unsurpassable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">"such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist by" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you will find words from the Mwamplap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" "- Beman your parents in recognition of how they tried to do you in your younger years."</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil like:</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these" insurmountable "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"speakers of the" Treasure Languages, "which are highly appreciated by untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1001">"my girlfriend looks at me and says," "These things do not concern you, or?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "I ask."</seg>

<seg id="1004">They kidnapped me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify ourselves to be a Muslim, to different kinds. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination, that as soon as Muslims, who, as I do not fit in, must be eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be mitigated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">"as Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died, the center of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"but in the western idea, the religion of Rumis was deleted, as is the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reductionist images of Muslims that have colonised western books for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1027">"this narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and sucking Saudi, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, these are two sides of the same coin."</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has been so deep and flawed by our collective imagination that Sikh-men and children are often aimed at anti-Muslim attacks and chicanings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">"because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of" others. ""</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the world languages can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening often is often associated with understanding "these events are instead" listening to the audience, to feel, to feel. ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story in their own language first and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation lead to the audience's audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the fables of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to talk to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, various religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration; the march started with the Puertorte Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the Gruppo" Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la deuda "(civic front for the re-examination of debts), and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Ricos."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the renewal of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without any personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions related remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our retirees will not be reconciled with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book wants to discuss how motions are built for free knowledge, and what are the real costs associated with."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra-prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and attorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "ported Bassel on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented himself as insider of the Assad administration and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project based in Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more provisioning than the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would all set out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripe into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life on dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mosambians responded with anger to a corruption case, in which a government member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other defendants because of undisputed 54 million Metikal (approx. 800 000 Euro)."</seg>

<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which advertised the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not fulfil any discipline proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not have the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integria de Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the Director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we should be aware of is that the company should have directed a disciplinary procedure against the acting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seems to be silent and no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "vile" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to cause damage."</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacked morals to return and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only served himself in the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state to act as an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally condemned to a long sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network recorded their posts on the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or the" "large-scale" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely dismal connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "Kalar" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically cry out hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that there were also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesan words with fundamental meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written in Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalterbse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebook user Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmesan - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will lessen hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it extinguishes all posts which are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you're writing on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words adjacent."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (ages).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curb its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and the Liken, post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post" didn't elucidate the Facebook community standards. "</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have prohibited such words as" "chair" "or" "Erbsencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, it would be great."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has opened the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many techniques-savvy Internet users are used to use circumnavigation tools for blocked websites (a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has blocked article from Wikipedia, as recently blocked in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now multiple mirrors (sites that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put down all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names, making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set all about mapping Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read content on decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently from the Wikimedia Foundation and is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to rectify the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the border of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly in Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he was already on the face of the Tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buweik appeared. he went straight away, we see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should abstain the standard of preserving this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having contacted a married kinsman with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of calling their wives also not by their names is also common among men. however, they have far fewer admittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health guards as well as housewives, entered a unique club and became quickly to the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the details of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the Community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the exploitation of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as child marriages to exile from HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands by their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their husbands not to speak out loud, is a custom that they all have to be dutiful and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband so far, wanted to try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everybody," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands over their lips," Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women must never pronounce the names of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she stood before herself during the whole exercise, and another decided to release the whole increased frustration against him and his family by curbing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and told her that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I should do it. ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less comprehensible and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead indicating the married status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoff dot if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped with it, but they think they are now in a better position to self-choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip on every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"it's okay for most people, but some wanted to wear a salami curta, a wide shirt over a pant, they didn't trust."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morality associated with the saris and much more, smuggled Rohini put their own pair of curtas (upper shirts) into a roundtable so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming to the reels:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then again listened to the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and do not have any other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their life - like the violets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "news of those who experience them", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may appear silly, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international scale."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the biosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, whereby most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">Cavalierio's blog accused the Minister of Justice to "reverse the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one can say that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries "in view of this, it appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equal cities which are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers who pretend Democrats to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests about our press, our judicial representative, and our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked questions of rational nature with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K. Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his comment on the blog, he pointed out to the critics that one should start reading the full address of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disassembles the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam committed a mistake, or was it a Freudian slip-up speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why does the people of Singapore make their military service, they only defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>

<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question posed most to me in Japan is:" "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to be polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification then usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother them."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp 'nice.</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" nice "means to be fun - like the good, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>

<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop-band famous in Thailand released a music video that parounded the junta, which seized power in 2014, and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to rule."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his girlfriend's instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the country's position under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos from the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian Section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision-making authority over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program for" change in settings "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose a new unit was established in the army, supervised by online content and people accused of being slandered by the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (Most Great).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the video even shows how people are thrown into a black vaulted cart before putting them into an internment store, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula and is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, she knows many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 Dollar the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject nobody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buys them medication which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family arrived from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to arrive to Boston, to find her husband and the three children there."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the track and that Africans speak at Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he responds smiling. "we will always remain in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get an appropriate price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single traveller, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travellers consult their telephones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves with many photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair fleets, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presented her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang of Twitter users, which is made by Twitter users"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that" "the app" "should prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also knew how to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police report that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online, and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the children's filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based Media Outlet" Images from Consumer China "(which was published in the list of the popping up news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked the inhabitants if they had installed the Surveillance App."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are using a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the passwords for a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the cyber security office instructions to operate their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos, "but this action does not violate Urumquis's personality rights, and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" sleep or death, "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane has described his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far away from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has been dissolved after and after, revealing a truth that is clearly recognisable both from inside and outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all glory to its name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actress, beautiful scenes and the performer, the characters turn into being of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the Earth rotates on the axis of the evil. you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"during a peaceful protest, five young people were thrown out of the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all quarters of the city were coveted, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was still, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I had no high expectations of a city that is stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"during the third night things had calmed down, after the power supply stopped functioning in the quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by crying out several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice reluctant because of the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we were allied to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations fully and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp, but you simply don't be interested in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father," "Make ready, we meet at the military security building." ""</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice back, after you have cried out the whole way up to the office of the security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to say," Let me also hear how you scream "Allahu Akbar" or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hasserted eyes were upon me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you grieve what to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">"I was so sure of my cause when I replied," I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday. "</seg>
<seg id="2026">"I think I've never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I do not regret the word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, right away."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture that I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a walk to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I concede all details just before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably assigned me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with only one other prisoner, and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the civil servant left the cell, and I went back to an old-proven communication method: to beat the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-guy was a "self-mate."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be recognized by me, and doctors are not there; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice is similar to mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator assured me that they would release him if I stay.</seg>

<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that Black was the color of perdition until I saw the yellow light that shows us the horror in person: the Raad (such as:" "thunder", "allusion on the 13th prostitute of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was ventilated: to protect the state security from us and prevent the traitors and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational blackout cards and betrayed the close vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a land; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I supervised the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he catches a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that derive him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I did nothing to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube probably from the lump.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hangman rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold your cries back."</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries liked him not enough so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked as a garbage collector, or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables in order to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them alternate, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noted the cooling and did not find any favours, which is why he intervened as a neighbour to an electrically loaded stick."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>

<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with dir, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person:" my Lord, my father must be fearful. ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you will be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he vows to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyeen (for example: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own circumstances," "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a human, "while in water he shakes Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, there is a lukewarm coffee and rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic Action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsänger, Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said that the concert was" straight "because of sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the time-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila cherished the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply a kind of rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib carried out traditional sex rhythms to his body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently dwinded woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" "Honour killings" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still more difficult that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can" be held in jail for an indefinite period of time, "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not take anything."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from issues which have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not capable of separating his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was smitten," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it Faith or Non-belief, Hetero- or Homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that commentaries on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to later notice that his comments were drawn from the context, distorted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, streamed but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals is not about Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who later would work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordaniers not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they would have critically expressed themselves on comments in social media about the problems linked with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how it looks like hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "experience it". ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be crowned with music, art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, scatter unitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until now, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these great, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas Tohokus in August. another theory states that the wagons, drums and dancing marched over more than a thousand years in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emissions, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed carriages are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and yet a stunning way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NabutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a yard of 18 meters was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outwardly outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the barber."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road smokers and illegal drug trade are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for cosmetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the styling of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the barber art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "love messages of guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, affection affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the Cartas por la Reconciliación campaign (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write down guerrilla fighters letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC Guerilla Defense Forces that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to a war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - which is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we are the people we love to write on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"in this year he plans to share his love with people, who needed most urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of encouragement from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness, and everything in between, "said the writer Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a staff of the Governor of the province Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I looked into one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters lived), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatlauncher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what do you do?" "he answered," "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody wrote something such a beautiful thing, so I answer it." suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat next to the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was also tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the meeting, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more equitable. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this scale is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many ex-fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after disarming there would have been peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms, rise and protest for their rights. and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will imminent many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which hangs like a sword of Damocles over the local LGBTQ community, is not only created overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual wife from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published which discussed the deportation, torture and killing queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that in reality she was a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechshes had experienced the sex adjustment of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was an honorary helper for a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day someone told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the round."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I sensed something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long do you want to honor the family, du Schandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had received everything and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals have you been placed - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is my male name on it. but the doctor understood and laid me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for it.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they wanted to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grony and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only corrupted your family, but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with blinding windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering without me, without ID, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you wouldn't believe, you'd be safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you put in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equation, that is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best in order not to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have fallen behind?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not finish a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"thus, I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end they demand proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to place themselves Kadyrows judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show off their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know, whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already well known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "Civilization", "but finally thrown us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, carried tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of the Sharia has never curbed me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharkov ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long has this grace period lasted?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people by myself when I stumbled away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddego?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no boils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Pazardines have which, the Russians also have whatever; on the whole planet there is them - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so I am uncomfortable to hear such things."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transitions to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not at all sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th regained the desperate situation of the Arab Ahraazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, so Ahmad-human rights groups who work in Ahwaz want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly manage to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Talegani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the incinerators were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August, within the Arab Ahraazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahraazi Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Hamid Maniath, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed themselves this month."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all fathers of the family who felt helpless and incapable of supporting their families, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahraazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where a large part of the Arab Ahraazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and made an effort in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses Ahraazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youngsters rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, labour and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahraazis who were looking for a job, completed the primary school, had completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify with feminism even with the intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even stack well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of equal education women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is well known to me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I bond twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTI community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention what kind of physical, spiritual and verbal misuse, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not associate myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account unrighteousness in her mind, which refers to both the sex and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a entmensworn and marginalized being in a historic sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which are also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the significance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women more information a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana, anism: recall ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create rooms where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle up against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports inparticular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa travelled throughout the last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the flow that we had lost when I was still a child," says Musa. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeepers Iraq - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film in Erbil, in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on traced, little respectable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" "by Kurtural."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another Mrs. Balbuena showed for mistreatment, the Ada Báez saw nothing more useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her display."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women provide an indication, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, admit to be victims of violence, are at all reporting to the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalts1 Strips and Statistik2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that contains nothing less than 3 of Paraguay's laws: good approach, flawed implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research facility in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available numbers are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence in the County State Prosecutor's Office. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too, 86% of the ads of women came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." on every woman who reports in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who is refunded due to physical abuse will come to two women who do not do so," she concluded at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own crime, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without complicity there is no firmness. # Non-Arab" photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible abuses and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then there was still. this should be regretted for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years, she carried the psychic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report the ill-treatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the agencies in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, it received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner, which developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and its home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of its former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays legislation: good approach - flawed implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürst)."</seg>

<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research conducted on site, there are two reasons: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is conducted by African scientists, helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness, and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more Salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartel varieties. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer, since his work becomes more and more difficult due to ever increasing restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river there would be a boulder around which I must dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed any new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman mersburger Type Outredness in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it will be tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed produced by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" open Source "growers only allow others to buy seeds, cross it to breed their own varieties, and it does not immediately sow it - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Board Member Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." in order to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, "he says and participates in the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered on farmers markets in August and September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to making their seed available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genetic pool is shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, engaged in her doctorate with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are still no such estimates, but experts such as Luby suggest that massive congested plants like wheat are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibilities</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desirable characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves, through which they thrive in certain environments and prevent threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predicable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property enables other breeders to promote innovation as" patents and the protection of plant varieties innovate. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation but also promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, there are certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for a long time to breed with plants, which are adapted to the changed environment conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton interfered with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the attributes themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants are formed by themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State Oregon and OSSI Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation mass-wise herbicides that breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such companies moving on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my rivals are selling my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, which makes it really easy for my opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the U.S. seems to be the leader in the" open source, "the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, introduces a" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agreda works on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeders differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find out about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official start of the official start of the year should be planned. "</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context, from the Luby of OSSI hopes that soon more people will recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2763">"this is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty."</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">An extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that didn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecelia Oliveira is arguing that the violence as a" war "is arguing that this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-falsifying neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports on chicans and repressions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio did not meet the criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally sourced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the long blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>

<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not among the traditional ones in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. but their food, however, makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the directorship of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the week before in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">"forty-two people died, and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires on 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called for a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days."</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took that which was left of his modest wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," "he remembered in an interview with Global Voices." we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked. "</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night.</seg>

<seg id="2932">"the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill, which stipulates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"users would need to be able to use the social networks, register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final judgment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal in which harder sanctions would be introduced to insult the president or senior officials."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under Egyptian law, the offending of the president as well as state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who was arrested on 13 August 2013, when he showed violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the imitation of the elected president Mohamed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 demonstrators arrested in the same incident, four years in prison on a court."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the detention of human rights groups failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges of among other things cease-possession, illegal assembly, murder and murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case a criminal court in Giza exempted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi session on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listens to skillful documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was primarily interrogated by the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan, was explicitly endorsed by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, was expressly granted a controversial bill of law, accused of businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused of giving back all illegal money."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on the Nawaat website on 21 April, sheds light on how the pressive plans for the support of the legislation will look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia refused to nominate his sources, stating from Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules will also indicate that registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
